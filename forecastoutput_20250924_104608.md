Found Research for URL dummy://test.com:\nRecent research topics include the latest anti-aging medical breakthroughs and current trends in human longevity. Although no specific articles were found, both topics are pertinent to forecasting the age of the oldest human by 2100. The current longevity record is 122 years, and ongoing medical advancements may push this boundary further. Understanding these topics is crucial for predicting future human lifespan extensions.

Reasoning from forecaster1 for URL dummy://test.com: 1. Rephrased and Expanded Question:
What is the probable age of the oldest human being as of the year 2100, considering the current record of 122 years and potential advances in medical science that may extend human longevity? This estimate should be based on the official Guinness World Records criteria.

2. Base Rate/Extreme Outcomes:
Historically, the oldest verified age reached by a human is 122 years (Jeanne Calment). Over the past century, the record has incrementally increased, but not dramatically. Extreme outcomes would involve unprecedented breakthroughs in anti-aging or longevity science, potentially allowing humans to live significantly longer.

3. Reasonable Range Estimate:
Given historical trends and potential medical advancements, a reasonable range might be from 125 to 150 years. The lower end assumes modest improvements in longevity, while the upper end assumes significant breakthroughs in anti-aging technologies or treatments.

4. Factors for Lower Range:
- Lack of major breakthroughs in longevity science.
- Potential societal or environmental factors that negatively impact overall human health.
- Biological limits on human lifespan that are difficult to overcome.

5. Factors for Upper Range:
- Major advancements in genetics, biotechnology, and personalized medicine.
- Successful interventions to delay aging or reverse age-related decline.
- Improved global healthcare access and quality, contributing to longer lifespans.

6. Aggregated Considerations:
Considering historical trends, scientific progress, and potential breakthroughs, it is reasonable to expect some increase in the maximum human lifespan by 2100. However, extreme longevity (e.g., beyond 150 years) remains speculative without clear evidence of feasible breakthroughs.

7. Initial Probability Distribution:
- Percentile 10: 125 years
- Percentile 20: 130 years
- Percentile 40: 135 years
- Percentile 60: 140 years
- Percentile 80: 145 years
- Percentile 90: 150 years

8. Evaluation:
The initial distribution assumes a balanced view of potential advancements and limitations. It is important to consider that while breakthroughs could occur, they may not be universally accessible or effective. Thus, the distribution should reflect a conservative optimism.

9. Final Probability Distribution:
- Percentile 10: *125*
- Percentile 20: *130*
- Percentile 40: *135*
- Percentile 60: *140*
- Percentile 80: *145*
- Percentile 90: *150*
