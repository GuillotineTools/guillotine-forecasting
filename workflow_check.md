# Workflow Check Test
Simple test to verify GitHub Actions workflow is triggering.

## Expected:
- If workflow runs, this should be committed to repository by the workflow
- If workflow fails, we should see error messages
- If workflow doesn't trigger, we need to fix triggers

This is a diagnostic test.
