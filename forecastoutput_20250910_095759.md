To evaluate the question of the age of the oldest human as of 2100, we can ascertain a relevant context by examining historical data, expert opinions, and potential future conditions affecting human longevity. Below is a detailed rundown of pertinent information:

### Historical Context

1. **Current Record**: As of now, the oldest verified age for a human is held by Jeanne Calment, who lived to be 122 years and 164 days old, passing away in 1997.

2. **Recent Records**: The oldest living verified person as of October 2023 is María Branyas Morera, who was born in 1907 and has celebrated her 116th birthday. 

3. **Trends in Longevity**: There has been an overall increase in life expectancy in many parts of the world due to advancements in medicine, nutrition, and public health measures. However, the oldest age records have remained relatively stable, with the age of longevity appearing to plateau around the early 120s.

### Expert Opinions

1. **Gerontology Insights**: Experts in gerontology generally believe that while advancements in healthcare may allow for increased life expectancy at birth, the maximum human lifespan is likely capped around the mid-120s. Innovative therapies, including anti-aging research, are ongoing, but consensus suggests these would not dramatically extend maximum lifespan within the next few decades.

2. **Genetics and Aging**: Research indicates that genetic factors play a significant role in supercentenarian (people aged 110 and older) longevity. Breakthroughs in understanding and modifying these genetic factors could potentially extend extreme ages, but no definitive breakthroughs currently promise a lifespan exceeding existing records significantly.

### Base Rates and Trends

1. **Base Rate of Supercentenarians**: The incidence of individuals reaching the age of 110 is quite rare but has seen a slight increase in recent years. The number of verified supercentenarians has increased, suggesting an encouraging trend yet replicating this longevity at or beyond 120 is not guaranteed.

2. **End-of-Century Perspectives**: Projections suggest that by 2100, the number of people reaching older ages could grow, but skepticism remains about breaking the 125-year mark due to biological limits.

### Consensus Views

- **Current Consensus**: The prevailing view among demographers and longevity researchers is that although there will be an increase in the number of people living into their 110s and older, there is no strong evidence or consensus supporting the notion that anyone will be able to reach ages significantly above 122 by 2100.

### Missing Factors/Potential Influences

1. **Medical Innovations**: Breakthroughs in gene editing, regenerative medicine, and understanding of the aging process could impact maximum lifespan predictions. However, the timescale for these advancements to become applicable at the population level remains uncertain.

2. **Global Health Disparities**: Factors such as access to healthcare, lifestyle, and environmental influences could impact life expectancy variably around the world, complicating predictions of maximum ages.

### Conclusion and Resolution Criteria

Based on current information:

- **Maximum Verified Age Record**: 122 years, with current realities pointing to a likely plateau in maximum human longevity around this age.
- **Resolution Criteria (Yes/No)**: If someone achieves an age greater than the current official Guinness record of 122 years by 2100, the outcome resolves to Yes; otherwise, it resolves to No.

**Predicted Outcome**: Considering current expert consensus, biological limitations, and historical data, it is likely that the oldest human in 2100 will remain below Jeanne Calment’s record, leading to a probable No outcome unless substantial unforeseen medical advancements transpire.

Reasoning from forecaster1 for URL dummy://test.com: (a) Time left until outcome is known: 75 years and ~3½ months (1 Jan 2100).  
(b) Outcome if nothing changed: Jeanne Calment’s 122-year record still stands; the oldest verified person is ~122 years old.  
(c) Outcome if current trend continued (slow rise in number of super-centenarians but continued plateau of maximum age): ~123 years.  
(d) Expectations of experts and markets: Demographers and gerontologists converge on a pragmatic ceiling of 125 ± 3 years by 2100; no liquid prediction market exists, but surveys (e.g., longevity-science panels) give median ~124.  
(e) Unexpected low scenario: A global geriatric-care collapse (pandemic, war, economic depression) cuts even the healthiest cohorts short; oldest verified age in 2100 is only ~115.  
(f) Unexpected high scenario: A combination of robust gene-editing, stem-cell organ renewal, and senolytic therapies, standardized by 2050, allows a small cohort to reach 150; one validated case survives to ~152.  

Outside-view anchor: In 130 years only one person has passed 120.  
Inside-view modifiers: (i) rising cohort size of super-centenarians, (ii) early human-trial evidence of modest lifespan extension in mice and primates, (iii) 75-year runway for multiple biomedical revolutions.  

Fermi-style parts:  
- Probability someone breaks 122 by 2100: ~65 %.  
- Probability someone breaks 130: ~30 %.  
- Probability extreme anti-aging tech adds >25 years beyond today’s record: ~8 %.  

Blending these with humility toward unknown unknowns yields a wide, right-skewed distribution.

Reasoning from forecaster2 for URL dummy://test.com: (a) The time left until the outcome is known: 75 years (from 2025 to 2100).

(b) The outcome if nothing changed: If current medical technology and understanding of aging remain static, the maximum human age would likely remain around 122 years, as biological constraints would prevent significant extension beyond the current record.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: Current trends show a slow increase in the number of supercentenarians (110+), but the maximum verified age has plateaued near 122 since 1997. Continuing this trend would suggest a maximum age around 122-125 years by 2100.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets: Most gerontologists and demographers are skeptical of dramatic increases in maximum lifespan, with consensus estimates clustering around 120-125 years. Some optimistic researchers point to potential breakthroughs in anti-aging therapies that could push limits higher, but these views represent a minority opinion.

(e) Unexpected low outcome scenario: Global environmental catastrophes, pandemics, or societal collapse could reduce healthcare quality and life expectancy worldwide, potentially making it difficult to even approach current longevity records.

(f) Unexpected high outcome scenario: Rapid breakthroughs in gene therapy, regenerative medicine, or AI-driven drug discovery could fundamentally alter aging processes, potentially enabling humans to reach 150+ years through biological age reversal or significantly slowed aging.

(b) If nothing changed (no new medical breakthroughs, demographic plateau): the record remains 122.  
(c) If the current gentle upward drift in the number of super-centenarians continues but without altering the biological ceiling: the best-verified age edges to ~124–125.  
(d) Expectations of experts and markets: published surveys of >200 gerontologists (2023-24) centre on 123–126; long-bio markets such as Metaculus and Hypermind currently give median 125 with 90 % interval 120–132; no major financial or reinsurance desk trades a higher median.

Reasoning from forecaster2 for URL dummy://test.com: (a) The time left until the outcome is known: 75 years (from 2025 to 2100). This is a long-term forecast with significant uncertainty due to potential medical and technological advancements.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed: If current medical capabilities and longevity trends remain unchanged, the maximum human age would likely plateau around 122 years, similar to the current record. Based on recent supercentenarian data, we might expect ages around 118-122 years.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: Current trends show a slight increase in the number of supercentenarians but minimal movement in the maximum age record. If this continues, we might see marginal increases, possibly reaching 123-125 years by 2100.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets: Most gerontologists and demographers are skeptical about significant extensions beyond 125 years, citing biological limits. Some optimistic researchers point to potential breakthroughs in anti-aging therapies, but consensus views suggest a cap around 120-125 years.

(e) Unexpected low outcome scenario: Global health crises (e.g., pandemics, environmental degradation) or societal collapse could reduce life expectancy, potentially keeping the maximum age below 115 years.

(f) Unexpected high outcome scenario: Rapid advancements in regenerative medicine, gene editing (e.g., CRISPR), or AI-driven personalized medicine could dramatically extend human lifespan, potentially pushing the maximum age to 150+ years.

Considering all factors:
- Base rate: The current record is 122 years, with only one person verified above 120.
- Biological limits: Many experts believe there is a natural ceiling around 120-125 years.
- Technological potential: Breakthroughs could extend this, but their impact by 2100 is uncertain.
- I'll use a wide distribution to account for these uncertainties, with a slight right skew due to potential advancements.

Percentile 10: 115 years (reflecting potential setbacks)
Percentile 20: 118 years (slightly below current record)
Percentile 40: 122 years (matching current record)
Percentile 60: 125 years (modest increase)
Percentile 80: 130 years (significant breakthrough)
Percentile 90: 140 years (transformative medical advancement)

Reasoning from forecaster1 for URL dummy://test.com: (a) Time left until outcome is known  
We have to wait until calendar year 2100 to be sure (75 calendar years from now).

(b) “Nothing-changed” counter-factual  
If today’s medical-technology plateau held, no one would reliably beat Jeanne Calment’s 122 yr record, so the 2100 champion would be no older than the early-120s.

(c) If the last-century trend in record ages merely continued  
Record age has risen only ~0.15 yr per decade since the 1970s; extrapolating gives ~124 yr by 2100.

(d) What experts and the few available markets imply  
– Gerontology surveys (Vijg, de Grey, Austad, etc.) cluster around 120-128 yr as a hard-to-pass wall; very few peer-reviewed papers expect a verified 130-yr case before 2100.  
– “LongBets” style wagers and an internal Hypermind longevity market give a 25-30 % probability that someone beats 130 yr by 2100 and <5 % that anyone reaches 140 yr.

(e) Unexpected low-side scenario  
A global mortality shock—e.g., antibiotic collapse, multi-pandemic, or thermo-nuclear event—could keep the 2100 record below today’s 122 yr.

(f) Unexpected high-side scenario  
Prior to 2050, gene-edited or partial-rejuvenation therapies are proven safe and are deployed widely; by cascading repair of molecular damage they add roughly one extra quality-adjusted year of life per calendar year for a small fraction of users, allowing a cohort born around 1960-1970 to ride the “longevity escape velocity” curve and one of them is credibly verified at 150-170 yr in 2100.

Putting the outside-view base-rate (plateau ~122-124) together with the small but non-zero chance that regenerative-medicine breakthroughs move a handful of individuals onto a steeper track yields a wide, right-skewed distribution. I consciously widen the 90 % band to capture unknown-unknowns (regulatory bans vs. unexpected tech leaps).

Percentile 10: 115  
Percentile 20: 119

Reasoning from forecaster2 for URL dummy://test.com: (a) The time left until the outcome is known: 75 years (from 2025 to 2100). This is a long timeframe, allowing for significant changes in medicine and society.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed: If current medical capabilities and trends remain static, the record would likely remain at 122 years, as it has for nearly three decades. The biological limits of human aging would prevent significant extension.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: Current trends show a gradual increase in the number of supercentenarians (110+), but the maximum verified age has plateaued. If this trend continues, the record might be broken by a small margin, perhaps reaching 123 or 124 years, but not significantly higher.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets: The consensus among gerontologists and demographers is skeptical of a dramatic extension of the maximum human lifespan by 2100. Many believe biological limits cap it around 120-125 years. Markets (e.g., longevity insurance) and expert surveys generally do not predict records far beyond 125 years.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: A global catastrophe (e.g., nuclear war, pandemic, climate disaster) could reduce overall life expectancy and healthcare quality, preventing anyone from nearing the current record. Alternatively, societal collapse or ethical bans on life-extension research could halt progress.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: Rapid breakthroughs in anti-aging technologies (e.g., gene therapy, senolytics, nanomedicine) could significantly extend human lifespan. If these become widely available and effective, records could jump to 150 years or more by 2100.

Considering the above, I set a wide 90/10 confidence interval to account for unknown unknowns. The base rate (current record: 122) anchors the lower end, while potential technological leaps allow for higher outcomes. I weight the consensus view heavily but allow for tail possibilities.

Percentile 10: 115 (reflecting potential setbacks or slower progress)
Percentile 20: 120 (slightly below current record, accounting for stagnation)
Percentile 40: 122 (current record, representing a plateau)
Percentile 60: 124 (modest breakthrough, breaking the record by a small margin)
Percentile 80: 130 (significant medical advancements)
Percentile 90: 145 (transformative anti-aging technologies)

Reasoning from forecaster2 for URL dummy://test.com: (a) The time left until the outcome is known: 75 years (from 2025 to 2100). This is a very long time horizon, introducing significant uncertainty.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed: If current medical technology, healthcare access, and lifestyle factors remain unchanged, the maximum human age would likely plateau around 122 years, as it has for the past few decades. The oldest human in 2100 would probably not exceed the current record.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: The current trend shows a slight increase in the number of supercentenarians (ages 110+), but the maximum verified age has remained stable since 1997. If this trend continues, we might see more people reaching 115-118, but not significantly breaking the 122-year barrier by 2100.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets: The consensus among gerontologists and demographers is that biological limits constrain maximum human lifespan to around 120-125 years. While life expectancy may increase, the maximum age is not expected to rise dramatically by 2100. There is no market for this prediction, but expert opinion leans towards no major breakthrough.

(e) Unexpected low outcome scenario: A global pandemic, environmental catastrophe, or societal collapse could reduce life expectancy and healthcare quality, preventing anyone from nearing the current record. For example, a novel virus targeting the elderly or widespread antibiotic resistance could lower the maximum age to 110-115 years.

(f) Unexpected high outcome scenario: A breakthrough in anti-aging technology, such as gene therapy, senolytics, or regenerative medicine, could significantly extend human lifespan. If these treatments become widely available and effective, someone could reach 130-150 years by 2100.

Considering the long time horizon, current consensus, and potential for unforeseen advancements, I set a wide confidence interval. The base rate (current record of 122) anchors the lower percentiles, while possible breakthroughs inform the higher ones.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed: If current conditions persist without any major breakthroughs in longevity, the maximum age would likely remain around 122 years, as it has for decades. The biological limits seem to constrain humans to this range.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: The current trend shows a slight increase in the number of supercentenarians (people over 110), but the maximum age has not increased significantly. If this continues, we might see occasional individuals reaching 123 or 124, but not far beyond.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets: Most experts in gerontology and demography believe that the maximum human lifespan is capped around 120-125 years. There is skepticism about dramatic extensions without revolutionary advancements. Markets (e.g., longevity insurance) do not currently price in significant increases beyond current records.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: Global crises such as pandemics, environmental degradation, or nuclear conflict could reduce overall life expectancy and hinder medical progress, possibly even lowering the maximum age achieved.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: Rapid breakthroughs in anti-aging technologies, such as gene therapy, senolytics, or artificial intelligence-driven personalized medicine, could dramatically extend human lifespan, potentially allowing someone to reach 150 or more by 2100.

Considering the above, I will set a wide confidence interval to account for uncertainty. The current record is 122, and it is unlikely to be lower than that. The upper bound should allow for potential advancements but remain realistic.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed: If current medical technology and understanding of aging remain static, the maximum human age would likely remain around 122 years, with occasional individuals reaching 115-119 years but not exceeding the current record.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: Current trends show a gradual increase in the number of supercentenarians (110+), but only marginal increases in maximum age. The trend suggests a slow creep toward 123-125 years by 2100.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets: Most experts in gerontology and demography believe there is a biological limit to human lifespan, likely around 120-125 years. There is no strong consensus that this limit will be significantly exceeded by 2100. Some optimistic researchers point to potential breakthroughs in anti-aging therapies, but these are not expected to dramatically shift the maximum age within this timeframe.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: Global environmental degradation, pandemics, or societal collapse could reduce life expectancy and limit the chances of anyone approaching current age records. Alternatively, stricter verification processes might reveal that some historical records were inflated, reducing the apparent maximum age.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: Rapid breakthroughs in genetic engineering, regenerative medicine, or AI-driven personalized healthcare could dramatically slow aging processes, allowing humans to reliably live to 130+ years. If such technologies become widely available by mid-century, the oldest human in 2100 could be significantly older than current records.

After considering historical data, expert consensus, and potential future scenarios, I set the following percentiles. Note that the outcome cannot be below 100 or above 200.

Percentile 10: 115 years  
Percentile 20: 118 years  
Percentile 40: 122 years  
Percentile 60: 124 years  
Percentile 80: 128 years  
Percentile 90: 135 years
