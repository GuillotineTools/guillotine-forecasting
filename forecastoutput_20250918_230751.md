Found Research for URL dummy://test.com:
To assess the question of what the age of the oldest human will be as of 2100, we need to consider several factors, including current records, trends in human longevity, and expert opinions.

### Current Record
As of October 2023, the oldest verified person is Mar√≠a Branyas Morera, born on March 4, 1907, making her 116 years old. The Guinness World Records recognizes her as the oldest living person. The record for the oldest verified age is currently held by Jeanne Calment, who lived to be 122 years and 164 days, passing away in 1997.

### Trends in Longevity
1. **Advancements in Healthcare**: There have been significant advancements in healthcare, nutrition, and lifestyle that contribute to increased life expectancy. However, the rate of increase in maximum lifespan has not kept pace with average life expectancy improvements.
   
2. **Maximum Lifespan**: Research suggests that while average life expectancy may continue to rise, the maximum lifespan (the age of the oldest individuals) has remained relatively stable. The consensus among gerontologists is that the maximum human lifespan is likely capped around 120-125 years.

3. **Demographic Changes**: The global population is aging, with a growing number of centenarians. However, the number of individuals reaching extreme ages (beyond 110) remains small.

### Expert Opinions
- **Gerontologists**: Many experts believe that while we may see more people living into their 100s, the likelihood of someone surpassing Jeanne Calment's record is low. Some argue that biological limits exist that prevent humans from living significantly beyond 120 years.
- **Longevity Research**: Ongoing research into genetics, regenerative medicine, and anti-aging therapies may influence future longevity, but no definitive breakthroughs have been made that would suggest a significant increase in maximum lifespan by 2100.

### Base Rates and Consensus Views
- Historically, the oldest verified age has not exceeded 122 years. The base rate for individuals living beyond 120 years is extremely low, with only a handful of verified cases in history.
- The consensus view among experts is that while life expectancy may continue to rise, the maximum age is unlikely to exceed 125 years in the near future.

### Missing Factors
- **Unforeseen Medical Advances**: Breakthroughs in biotechnology or genetic engineering could potentially extend human lifespan beyond current expectations, but these remain speculative.
- **Environmental Factors**: Changes in global health crises, climate change, and lifestyle factors could also impact longevity in unpredictable ways.

### Conclusion
Based on current information, the most likely resolution of the question regarding the age of the oldest human as of 2100 is that it will not exceed 125 years, aligning with historical data and expert consensus. Therefore, if the question is framed as whether the age of the oldest human will be greater than 125 years, the answer would likely be **No**. However, if the question is simply about the age of the oldest human, it could be any age up to that limit, depending on future developments.

Reasoning from forecaster1 for URL dummy://test.com: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: 75 years (from 2025 to 2100).

(b) The outcome if nothing changed: The current record of 122 years would remain the highest age reached by a human.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: Given the slow increase in maximum lifespan, the age might slightly increase, potentially reaching around 123 to 125 years.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets: Experts generally expect the maximum human lifespan to remain around 120-125 years, with no significant breakthroughs currently anticipated that would drastically extend this limit.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: A global health crisis or environmental catastrophe significantly reduces life expectancy and the ability to reach extreme ages, resulting in a maximum age closer to 115 years.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: A major breakthrough in anti-aging technology or genetic engineering extends human lifespan significantly, allowing individuals to live well beyond 125 years, potentially reaching 130 years or more.

Final answer:
```
Percentile 10: 115
Percentile 20: 118
Percentile 40: 122
Percentile 60: 125
Percentile 80: 128
Percentile 90: 130
