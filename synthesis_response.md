### Analysis of the Consensus Among Forecasters

The six forecasts present a range of probabilities, from 15% to 35%, regarding whether someone born before 2000 will live to be 120 years old. The majority of the forecasts (Forecasts 2, 4, 5, and 6) lean toward a lower probability (15%-20%) of this outcome, while two forecasts (Forecasts 1 and 3) suggest a slightly higher probability (30%-35%). The primary consensus among the forecasters is that while advancements in medical and anti-aging technologies show promise, they are still in experimental stages and have not yet demonstrated the ability to significantly extend human lifespan beyond the current verified record of 122 years (held by Jeanne Calment). Additionally, the forecasts agree that the number of supercentenarians (those aged 110+) is increasing, but the upper limit of human lifespan has not shown a significant upward trend.

### Final Probability Assessment

After synthesizing the forecasts and weighing the reasoning and evidence provided, the final probability assessment is **25% - Yes**.

### Comprehensive Reasoning

The forecasts collectively highlight two key factors: (1) the potential of medical and anti-aging advancements, and (2) the lack of significant breakthroughs to date in extending the maximum human lifespan. Forecasts 1 and 3, which assign a higher probability (30%-35%), emphasize the possibility of experimental anti-aging research leading to a breakthrough or the emergence of an outlier individual. However, these forecasts acknowledge that such advancements are not yet mature enough to reliably extend lifespans beyond the current record.

On the other hand, Forecasts 2, 4, 5, and 6, which assign lower probabilities (15%-20%), argue that the current pace of progress and the lack of significant breakthroughs make it unlikely that someone born before 2000 will reach 120 years by 2050. These forecasts point to the rarity of individuals approaching 120 years and the experimental nature of many anti-aging technologies as key limiting factors.

The synthesis of these forecasts suggests that while there is a non-zero chance of someone born before 2000 living to 120, the probability remains relatively low. The consensus that advancements are still in experimental stages and the lack of significant upward trends in maximum lifespan support this conclusion. However, the possibility of a breakthrough or outlier event justifies a modest probability of 25%.

### Final Recommendation

**Probability: 25% - Yes**
