# Workflow Trigger Test
Testing enhanced logging and output commits in GitHub Actions.

## Features to Test:
1. âœ… Real tournament IDs (32813, minibench, brightline-watch)
2. âœ… Enhanced console logging showing exact model names
3. âœ… Auto-commit outputs to git repository
4. âœ… Detailed API call visibility in GitHub Actions
5. âœ… Success/failure logging for each model

## Expected GitHub Actions Output:
- ðŸ”„ CALLING MODEL: openrouter/deepseek/deepseek-chat
- ðŸŽ¯ MODEL SUCCESS: [specific model name]
- ðŸ“Š Response length and preview
- âœ… Output committed to git repository

This should trigger the workflow and demonstrate the enhanced logging.
