Full prompt:

I will provide you with a forecasting question and the background information for the question.
Question: Will the interest in “robert eugene brashers” change between 2025-10-17 and 2025-10-05 according to Google Trends?
Background: Google Trends is a free tool from Google that shows how often particular search terms are entered into Google relative to the total search volume across different regions and time periods. One of its main features is the “interest over time” graph, which is scaled from 0 to 100. In this graph, 100 represents the peak popularity of the term during the selected time range and location, meaning the point in time when searches for that term were at their highest. A 0 does not mean no searches occurred, but rather that the search interest was too low to register compared to the peak values. Because the values are relative, the numbers for a given day can shift as new data is added or as the overall scale is recalibrated—for example, a value of 40 on one day could later appear as 35 if the relative scaling changes. This effect can be reduced by specifying fixed start and end dates in the URL, which locks the scale for that chosen period and keeps the values consistent.

The current value of the topic “robert eugene brashers” at the time of writing this question compared to the last 30 days is 26; seen at [this url](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=robert%20eugene%20brashers&date=2025-08-29%202025-09-28).

`{"format":"trends_interest_change_magnitude","info":{"topic":"robert eugene brashers","trend_start":"2025-10-05","trend_end":"2025-10-17","verification_url":"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=robert%20eugene%20brashers&date=2025-09-17%202025-10-17"}}`

Task:
- Generate brief search queries (up to 10 words each) to gather information on Google that could influence the forecast.
- You must generate exactly 3 queries

Your response should take the following structure:

Question:
Will the interest in “robert eugene brashers” change between 2025-10-17 and 2025-10-05 according to Google Trends?

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below:
This question resolves “Doesn't change” if the value on the timeline at [https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=robert%20eugene%20brashers&date=2025-09-17%202025-10-17](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=robert%20eugene%20brashers&date=2025-09-17%202025-10-17) for 2025-10-17 is within 3 of the value at 2025-10-05. It resolves “Increases” if the value is more than 3 greater, and resolves “Decreases” if the value is more than 3 lower.

A script will be used to determine the resolution of this question. It will access the data on Google Trends using [SerpApi](https://serpapi.com/), and compare the height of the timeline for the two aforementioned dates. The specific python query will be structured as follows:
```
from serpapi import GoogleSearch

search = GoogleSearch(params={
"api_key": API_KEY,
"engine": "google_trends",
"data_type": "TIMESERIES",
"geo": "US",
"tz": 0,
"q": "robert eugene brashers",
"date": "2025-09-17 2025-10-17",
})
search.get_dict()
```
Note that there may be minor differences between the results returned by the API and the data appearing on the page. This seems to be due to the 'tz' parameter not having the intended effect in-browser. In this case, the API results will be considered authoritative.
Note that the precision of the timeline will be 1 day, so this will compare the overall interest for the whole day as determined by Google Trends.
Dates are determined in UTC.
If the data is no longer available, or the script fails, this question will be annulled or manually resolved by a moderator.

Will the interest in “robert eugene brashers” change between 2025-10-17 and 2025-10-05 according to Google Trends?

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below:
This question resolves “Doesn't change” if the value on the timeline at [https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=robert%20eugene%20brashers&date=2025-09-17%202025-10-17](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=robert%20eugene%20brashers&date=2025-09-17%202025-10-17) for 2025-10-17 is within 3 of the value at 2025-10-05. It resolves “Increases” if the value is more than 3 greater, and resolves “Decreases” if the value is more than 3 lower.

A script will be used to determine the resolution of this question. It will access the data on Google Trends using [SerpApi](https://serpapi.com/), and compare the height of the timeline for the two aforementioned dates. The specific python query will be structured as follows:
```
from serpapi import GoogleSearch

search = GoogleSearch(params={
"api_key": API_KEY,
"engine": "google_trends",
"data_type": "TIMESERIES",
"geo": "US",
"tz": 0,
"q": "robert eugene brashers",
"date": "2025-09-17 2025-10-17",
})
search.get_dict()
```
Note that there may be minor differences between the results returned by the API and the data appearing on the page. This seems to be due to the 'tz' parameter not having the intended effect in-browser. In this case, the API results will be considered authoritative.
Note that the precision of the timeline will be 1 day, so this will compare the overall interest for the whole day as determined by Google Trends.
Dates are determined in UTC.
If the data is no longer available, or the script fails, this question will be annulled or manually resolved by a moderator.

Full prompt:

You are an expert superforecaster, familiar with the work of Tetlock and others. Make probability estimates for each option in the multiple choice question. You MUST give probability estimates for ALL options that sum to 1.0 UNDER ALL CIRCUMSTANCES.

Question:
Will the interest in “robert eugene brashers” change between 2025-10-17 and 2025-10-05 according to Google Trends?

Options:
1. Increases
2. Doesn't change
3. Decreases

Question Background:
Google Trends is a free tool from Google that shows how often particular search terms are entered into Google relative to the total search volume across different regions and time periods. One of its main features is the “interest over time” graph, which is scaled from 0 to 100. In this graph, 100 represents the peak popularity of the term during the selected time range and location, meaning the point in time when searches for that term were at their highest. A 0 does not mean no searches occurred, but rather that the search interest was too low to register compared to the peak values. Because the values are relative, the numbers for a given day can shift as new data is added or as the overall scale is recalibrated—for example, a value of 40 on one day could later appear as 35 if the relative scaling changes. This effect can be reduced by specifying fixed start and end dates in the URL, which locks the scale for that chosen period and keeps the values consistent.

The current value of the topic “robert eugene brashers” at the time of writing this question compared to the last 30 days is 26; seen at [this url](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=robert%20eugene%20brashers&date=2025-08-29%202025-09-28).

`{"format":"trends_interest_change_magnitude","info":{"topic":"robert eugene brashers","trend_start":"2025-10-05","trend_end":"2025-10-17","verification_url":"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=robert%20eugene%20brashers&date=2025-09-17%202025-10-17"}}`

Resolution Criteria:
This question resolves “Doesn't change” if the value on the timeline at [https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=robert%20eugene%20brashers&date=2025-09-17%202025-10-17](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=robert%20eugene%20brashers&date=2025-09-17%202025-10-17) for 2025-10-17 is within 3 of the value at 2025-10-05. It resolves “Increases” if the value is more than 3 greater, and resolves “Decreases” if the value is more than 3 lower.

A script will be used to determine the resolution of this question. It will access the data on Google Trends using [SerpApi](https://serpapi.com/), and compare the height of the timeline for the two aforementioned dates. The specific python query will be structured as follows:
```
from serpapi import GoogleSearch

search = GoogleSearch(params={
"api_key": API_KEY,
"engine": "google_trends",
"data_type": "TIMESERIES",
"geo": "US",
"tz": 0,
"q": "robert eugene brashers",
"date": "2025-09-17 2025-10-17",
})
search.get_dict()
```
Note that there may be minor differences between the results returned by the API and the data appearing on the page. This seems to be due to the 'tz' parameter not having the intended effect in-browser. In this case, the API results will be considered authoritative.
Note that the precision of the timeline will be 1 day, so this will compare the overall interest for the whole day as determined by Google Trends.
Dates are determined in UTC.
If the data is no longer available, or the script fails, this question will be annulled or manually resolved by a moderator.

Your research assistant says:


Instructions:
1. Rephrase and expand the question to help you do better answering. Maintain all information in the original question.

2. For each option, using your knowledge of the world and topic, as well as the information provided, provide reasons why that option might be correct. Rate the strength of each reason.

3. Compare the options against each other, identifying which ones are more or less likely based on your analysis.

4. Aggregate your considerations. Think like a superforecaster (e.g. Nate Silver).

5. Output an initial probability distribution (predictions) given steps 1-4.

6. Evaluate whether your calculated probabilities are excessively confident or not confident enough. Also, consider anything else that might affect the forecast that you did not before consider (e.g. base rates of similar events).

7. Output your final probability distribution for ALL options with asterisks around each decimal, ensuring they sum to 1.0.

Follow these instructions carefully and provide your response in the exact format specified.
