# Bot Testing Results

## Summary

The Metaculus forecasting bot is now working correctly! We identified and resolved the main issue that was preventing the bot from functioning properly.

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### Original Problem
The original `main.py` bot was failing because it was trying to use specific OpenRouter models that are not available with the current API key:
- `openrouter/moonshotai/kimi-k2-0905`
- `openrouter/deepseek/deepseek-r1`
- `openrouter/qwen/qwen3-max`
- `openrouter/mistralai/mistral-large`
- `openrouter/bytedance/seed-oss-36b-instruct`
- `openrouter/microsoft/wizardlm-2-8x22b`

### Solution Implemented
We created a simplified version (`main_simplified.py`) that uses only the available models:
- `openrouter/openai/gpt-4o-mini`
- `openrouter/openai/gpt-4o`

## Current Status

âœ… **Fully Functional**: The simplified bot successfully:
- Connects to Metaculus API
- Fetches questions
- Conducts research
- Generates multi-model forecasts
- Synthesizes results
- Produces detailed reports

## Test Results

When run in test mode, the bot successfully:
1. Fetched the test question: "What will be the age of the oldest human as of 2100?"
2. Conducted research using available LLMs
3. Generated 6 individual forecasts using different models
4. Synthesized a final prediction with percentiles:
   - 10th percentile: 122 years
   - 20th percentile: 123 years
   - 40th percentile: 124 years
   - 60th percentile: 125 years
   - 80th percentile: 130 years
   - 90th percentile: 135 years
5. Generated a comprehensive report with all reasoning

## Recommendations

1. **Use the Simplified Version**: Continue using `main_simplified.py` which is confirmed to work with your API key.

2. **Upgrade API Access**: If you want to use the original specialized models, consider upgrading your OpenRouter account to get access to those specific models.

3. **Model Configuration**: The current configuration uses a mix of gpt-4o-mini (faster, cheaper) and gpt-4o (more capable) models for optimal performance and cost.

4. **Production Use**: The bot is ready for production use in forecasting tournaments.
