Reasoning from forecaster1 for URL dummy://test.com: 1. **Rephrased and Expanded Question:**  
What will be the age of the oldest officially recorded human according to the Guinness World Records as of the year 2100? The current record is 122 years, and with advancements in medical science and technology, there is a potential for this record to be surpassed.

2. **Base Rate/Extreme Outcomes:**  
The current record for the oldest verified human is 122 years, held by Jeanne Calment. Historically, only a few individuals have been verified to live beyond 115 years. Extreme outcomes in human longevity are rare, but medical advancements could potentially change this trend.

3. **Reasonable Range Estimation:**  
Given the current record and considering potential medical advancements, a reasonable range for the oldest human by 2100 could be between 120 and 140 years. The lower bound is close to the current record, while the upper bound considers substantial medical and technological breakthroughs.

4. **Factors for Lower Range:**  
- Limited breakthroughs in anti-aging research.
- Global health challenges, such as pandemics or insufficient healthcare access, limiting overall lifespan improvements.
- Biological constraints that may limit human lifespan despite medical advancements.

5. **Factors for Upper Range:**  
- Significant breakthroughs in genetics, regenerative medicine, and anti-aging technologies.
- Improved global healthcare systems and access to longevity-enhancing treatments.
- Advances in personalized medicine and lifestyle interventions.

6. **Aggregation and Superforecasting Considerations:**  
Considering historical data, current trends in longevity research, and potential future breakthroughs, it is reasonable to expect some increase in the age of the oldest human by 2100. However, the extent of this increase is uncertain and depends on numerous factors, including technological, social, and economic developments.

7. **Initial Probability Distribution (Percentiles):**  
- Percentile 10: 122 years
- Percentile 20: 125 years
- Percentile 40: 130 years
- Percentile 60: 135 years
- Percentile 80: 140 years
- Percentile 90: 145 years

8. **Evaluation of Distribution Confidence:**  
The initial distribution may be slightly optimistic given the current pace of medical advancements. However, considering the long time horizon until 2100, there is potential for unforeseen breakthroughs. The distribution should reflect cautious optimism, balancing historical data with future possibilities.

9. **Final Probability Distribution (Percentiles):**  
- Percentile 10: *122*
- Percentile 20: *125*
- Percentile 40: *128*
- Percentile 60: *132*
- Percentile 80: *137*
- Percentile 90: *142*

Reasoning from forecaster4 for URL dummy://test.com: ### Step 1: Rephrase and Expand the Question

What will be the age of the oldest human by the year 2100, as recorded by the official Guinness World Records? The current record is 122 years. Considering potential advancements in medicine and biotechnology, what could be the plausible range for this record by the end of the 21st century?

### Step 2: Consider Base Rate/Extreme Outcomes

Historically, the oldest verified age for a human is 122 years, held by Jeanne Calment. This record has stood for several decades, indicating its extremity. Throughout history, increases in maximum lifespan have been slow, with most gains in average lifespan rather than maximum lifespan. 

### Step 3: Estimate a Reasonable Range

Lower Bound: Given that the record has been 122 years for a long time, it is plausible that it could remain around this number if no significant breakthroughs occur. A reasonable lower bound might be 122-125 years.

Upper Bound: With potential advancements in genetic engineering, regenerative medicine, and other biotechnologies, it is conceivable that the maximum lifespan could extend significantly. An upper bound might be around 150 years, considering radical but plausible advancements.

### Step 4: Factors for Lower End

- Lack of significant breakthroughs in aging research or failure to translate these into human applications.
- Possible societal, economic, or environmental setbacks that limit healthcare advancements.
- Continued natural biological limits on human lifespan.

### Step 5: Factors for Upper End

- Breakthroughs in anti-aging research, such as telomere extension or effective anti-aging drugs.
- Advances in personalized medicine and genetic engineering.
- Improvements in global healthcare systems, nutrition, and living standards.

### Step 6: Aggregate Considerations

Considering historical trends and potential future advancements, the most likely outcomes are modest increases in maximum lifespan. However, the possibility of significant breakthroughs cannot be ignored.

### Step 7: Initial Probability Distribution

- Percentile 10: 122 years
- Percentile 20: 125 years
- Percentile 40: 130 years
- Percentile 60: 135 years
- Percentile 80: 140 years
- Percentile 90: 145 years

### Step 8: Evaluate Confidence

The distribution should reflect uncertainty about future technological and medical advancements. The range is broad to accommodate both incremental and radical changes in lifespan extension. 

### Step 9: Final Probability Distribution

- Percentile 10: *122*
- Percentile 20: *125*
- Percentile 40: *130*
- Percentile 60: *135*
- Percentile 80: *140*
- Percentile 90: *145*
