# Workflow Status Check
Checking if GitHub Actions workflow is running and completing.

## Status Indicators:
- If this gets committed by workflow → Step 1 (tournament diagnosis) worked
- If no commit after 5 minutes → Workflow not triggering or failing early
- Should see tournament info files if diagnosis step works

This is a test to see if the workflow is even reaching the git commit stage.
