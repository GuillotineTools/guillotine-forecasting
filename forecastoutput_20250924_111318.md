Found Research for URL dummy://test.com:\nThe research conducted on the future of anti-aging medicine and predictions for human lifespan by 2100 did not yield specific articles, but the topics are pertinent to forecasting questions regarding lifespan extensions. The inquiry into the future of anti-aging medicine in 2100 suggests a potential for significant advancements, even though no precise studies were found. Similarly, research on predictions for human lifespan by 2100 and future human lifespan predictions also lacked specific articles but remain crucial to understanding potential lifespan developments. These topics are relevant for considering the age of the oldest human by 2100, given that the current record is 122 years. Advances in medicine, particularly in anti-aging technologies, may play a critical role in extending human longevity, suggesting that the age of the oldest human could surpass current records by the end of the century.

Reasoning from forecaster1 for URL dummy://test.com: ### Rephrased and Expanded Question

What will be the age of the oldest human alive as of the year 2100, according to the official Guinness World Record? The current record is 122 years, held by Jeanne Calment. Considering the potential advancements in medicine, particularly anti-aging technologies, what is a reasonable forecast for the maximum human age by the end of the 21st century?

### Base Rate/Extreme Outcomes

Historically, the oldest verified age reached by a human is 122 years. This record was set by Jeanne Calment, who lived from 1875 to 1997. Other supercentenarians have lived to ages slightly above 110, but none have surpassed 122 years. The record has stood for over 25 years, indicating the rarity of such longevity.

### Reasonable Range Estimation

Given the current record of 122 years, a reasonable lower bound could be slightly above this, around 123 years, assuming that it is possible for someone to just surpass the current record. An upper bound might be set at around 140 years, considering significant medical advancements and breakthroughs in anti-aging technologies.

### Factors for Lower Range

1. **Biological Limits**: There may be inherent biological limits to human lifespan that are difficult to surpass, even with medical advancements.
2. **Slow Medical Progress**: Advances in anti-aging technology may not progress as quickly as hoped, limiting significant extensions in lifespan.
3. **Societal and Economic Factors**: Limited access to advanced healthcare could prevent widespread benefits from anti-aging technologies.

### Factors for Upper Range

1. **Breakthroughs in Medicine**: Significant scientific breakthroughs could dramatically extend human lifespan and healthspan.
2. **Improved Healthcare**: Global improvements in healthcare access and quality could contribute to longer lifespans.
3. **Genetic Engineering**: Advances in genetic engineering and regenerative medicine could overcome current biological limitations.

### Aggregated Considerations

Considering historical precedents, potential medical advancements, and the inherent uncertainties, it is reasonable to expect some increase in the maximum recorded age by 2100. However, it is unlikely to be extreme due to biological constraints and the unpredictable nature of scientific progress.

### Initial Probability Distribution

- Percentile 10: 123
- Percentile 20: 125
- Percentile 40: 130
- Percentile 60: 134
- Percentile 80: 138
- Percentile 90: 140

### Evaluation of Confidence

The initial distribution may be slightly optimistic on the upper end, given the historical stability of the 122-year record. Adjusting for potential overconfidence in medical advancements, the distribution should reflect a more conservative upper bound.

### Final Probability Distribution

- Percentile 10: *123*
- Percentile 20: *125*
- Percentile 40: *128*
- Percentile 60: *132*
- Percentile 80: *136*
- Percentile 90: *138*

Reasoning from forecaster2 for URL dummy://test.com: ### 1. Rephrased and Expanded Question:
"What will be the age of the oldest verified human alive as of January 1, 2100, as recorded by the Guinness World Records, given the current record of 122 years and potential advances in anti-aging medicine and longevity research?"

### 2. Base Rate and Historical Precedents:
- The current verified record is Jeanne Calment, who lived to 122 years (1875–1997).  
- The second-oldest verified person lived to 119 years.  
- Over the past century, the maximum human lifespan has increased only modestly (~5-10 years), despite significant advances in medicine and public health.  
- Supercentenarians (110+ years) are rare, and the pace of increase in maximum lifespan has been slow compared to life expectancy gains.  

### 3. Reasonable Range:
- **Lower bound**: 122 years (current record, assuming no significant breakthroughs).  
- **Upper bound**: 150 years (assuming revolutionary advances in aging biology, such as senolytics, gene therapy, or AI-driven personalized medicine).  
- Most plausible range: 125–140 years.  

### 4. Factors Pushing Toward Lower End (122–130 years):
- Limited progress in anti-aging interventions (e.g., failed clinical trials, regulatory hurdles).  
- Societal or environmental crises (pandemics, climate disruptions) reducing lifespans.  
- Biological limits to human cellular repair mechanisms.  

### 5. Factors Pushing Toward Upper End (140+ years):
- Breakthroughs in longevity science (e.g., epigenetic reprogramming, telomere extension).  
- Widespread adoption of preventative and regenerative medicine.  
- AI-accelerated drug discovery and personalized health optimization.  

### 6. Aggregation (Superforecaster Thinking):
- Base rate suggests slow progress, but tail risks from exponential tech exist.  
- Most likely: Moderate extension (~125–135 years).  
- Low probability of stagnation (<125) or radical extension (>150).  

### 7. Initial Probability Distribution (Percentiles):
- 10%: ≤122  
- 20%: ≤125  
- 40%: ≤130  
- 60%: ≤135  
- 80%: ≤140  
- 90%: ≤150  

### 8. Calibration Check:
- Initial range may be overly optimistic about upper tail (150+). Adjust to reflect higher uncertainty.  
- Add small probability (>1%) for extreme outliers (e.g., >160) due to unknown unknowns.  

### 9. Final Probability Distribution:
- Percentile 10: *122*  
- Percentile 20: *125*  
- Percentile 40: *130*  
- Percentile 60: *135*  
- Percentile 80: *145*  
- Percentile 90: *155*  

### Rationale for Adjustments:
- Widened upper percentiles to account for uncertainty in breakthrough timing and adoption.  
- Kept lower percentiles conservative, as stagnation is plausible.  
- Acknowledged tail risk of "longevity escape velocity" but assigned low probability.
