Found Research for URL dummy://test.com:
Research on advances in medicine related to life expectancy, anti-aging medicine in 2023, and trends in human longevity in the 21st century found no specific articles, but these topics are crucial for forecasting human lifespan. The key question is: What will be the age of the oldest human by 2100? The current record is 122 years, and advancements in medical science could potentially extend this. Understanding the impact of medical progress, particularly in anti-aging and longevity trends, is essential for making informed predictions about future human lifespan limits.
