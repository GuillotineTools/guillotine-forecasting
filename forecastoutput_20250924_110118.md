Reasoning from forecaster1 for URL dummy://test.com: ### Rephrased and Expanded Question:
What is the likely age of the oldest human as recorded by the Guinness World Records by the year 2100, considering current trends in medical advancements and anti-aging technology? The current record stands at 122 years, and there is potential for this to be surpassed due to ongoing research and innovation in extending human lifespan.

### Base Rate and Historical Precedents:
The current oldest verified age is 122 years, held by Jeanne Calment. Historically, the record for human lifespan has increased very slowly. The record of 122 years has stood since 1997. In the past century, the maximum reported age has only increased by a few years, suggesting that significant breakthroughs would be needed to see a substantial increase by 2100.

### Reasonable Range Estimation:
- **Lower Bound:** 122 years (assuming no significant medical breakthroughs and similar longevity trends as seen historically).
- **Upper Bound:** 140 years (assuming significant medical advancements and breakthroughs in anti-aging treatments).

### Factors for Lower End:
- Lack of significant medical breakthroughs.
- Biological limits to human lifespan.
- Societal or environmental factors that could negatively impact longevity.

### Factors for Upper End:
- Breakthroughs in genetics, regenerative medicine, and anti-aging research.
- Improved healthcare and living conditions globally.
- Advances in technology that mitigate age-related diseases.

### Aggregated Considerations:
Considering the slow historical increase in maximum age and the potential for medical advancements, a modest increase in the record is plausible. However, reaching or exceeding 140 years would likely require unprecedented breakthroughs.

### Initial Probability Distribution:
- Percentile 10: 122 years
- Percentile 20: 125 years
- Percentile 40: 130 years
- Percentile 60: 134 years
- Percentile 80: 137 years
- Percentile 90: 140 years

### Evaluation:
The initial distribution reflects a cautious optimism about medical advancements. It assumes some progress in extending human lifespan but remains conservative about radical breakthroughs. Given the uncertainties in predicting future medical breakthroughs, the distribution should not be overly confident.

### Final Probability Distribution:
- Percentile 10: *122*
- Percentile 20: *125*
- Percentile 40: *130*
- Percentile 60: *134*
- Percentile 80: *137*
- Percentile 90: *140*
