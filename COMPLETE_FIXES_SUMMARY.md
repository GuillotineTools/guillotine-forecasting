# Complete Summary of Fixes for Metaculus Forecasting Bot

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. **Bot Not Forecasting on New Questions**
- **Problem**: The bot wasn't forecasting on the unemployment question (ID 39582)
- **Root Cause**: The question belongs to the "Fall 2025 AI Forecasting Benchmark tournament" (slug: `fall-aib-2025`), but the bot was only checking tournaments that had 0 open questions
- **Solution**: Updated the bot to check the `fall-aib-2025` tournament using the ApiFilter approach

### 2. **Metaculus Cup Tournament Issues**
- **Problem**: The `metaculus-cup` slug wasn't working due to a teammate changing it
- **Root Cause**: Tournament slug was changed, but the code was still using the old slug
- **Solution**: Updated the bot to use the correct tournament ID (32828) instead of the slug

### 3. **Multiple Forecaster Configuration Issue**
- **Problem**: Misconfiguration in `predictions_per_research_report`
- **Root Cause**: Set to 6 when using 6 forecasters, which would result in 36 predictions per question
- **Solution**: Changed to 1 since we have 6 forecasters, resulting in 6 predictions per question

## Technical Fixes Implemented

### In `main.py`:
1. **Fixed multiple forecaster configuration**:
   - Changed `predictions_per_research_report` from 6 to 1

2. **Added Fall AIB 2025 tournament**:
   - Added code to query the `fall-aib-2025` tournament by slug using ApiFilter
   - Used `forecast_questions` method instead of `forecast_on_tournament` for this tournament

3. **Fixed Metaculus Cup tournament**:
   - Updated to use ID 32828 instead of the broken slug

4. **Enhanced error handling and logging**:
   - Added better logging to show which tournaments are being checked
   - Improved error handling in GitHub Actions environment

### In GitHub Actions workflows:
1. **Added proper environment variables**:
   - Added `GITHUB_ACTIONS: "true"` 
   - Added `GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`

## Verification Results

### Unemployment Question (ID 39582):
- ✅ Belongs to `fall-aib-2025` tournament
- ✅ Accessible via ApiFilter query
- ✅ Will now be forecasted by the bot

### Tournament Queries:
- ✅ Direct ID query for AIB_FALL_2025_ID (32813) returns 0 questions
- ✅ ApiFilter query for `fall-aib-2025` slug returns 100 questions
- ✅ Direct ID query for Metaculus Cup (32828) returns 9 questions

## Next Steps for Verification

1. **Monitor next scheduled GitHub Actions run**:
   - Verify the bot forecasts on the unemployment question
   - Confirm all 6 forecasters are being used
   - Check that forecasts are submitted to Metaculus successfully

2. **Check logs for proper tournament coverage**:
   - AI Competition Tournament (ID: 32813)
   - MiniBench Tournament (ID: minibench) 
   - Fall AIB 2025 Tournament (slug: fall-aib-2025)
   - Metaculus Cup Tournament (ID: 32828)

## Additional Notes

- The issue with ID-based vs slug-based tournament queries appears to be a bug in the forecasting-tools library
- The ApiFilter approach is more reliable for querying tournaments by slug
- The Metaculus Cup slug issue was due to a manual change by a teammate, now resolved by using the permanent ID
