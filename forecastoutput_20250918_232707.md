Found Research for URL dummy://test.com:
To assess the question of the age of the oldest human as of 2100, we will need to analyze current trends in longevity, demographic data, advancements in healthcare, and historical records. Here’s a detailed rundown of the relevant information:

### Current Records and Trends
1. **Current Record Holders**: As of October 2023, the oldest verified person is María Branyas Morera, born on March 4, 1907, making her 116 years old. The oldest verified person ever was Jeanne Calment, who lived to be 122 years and 164 days.

2. **Longevity Trends**: The trend in human longevity has been increasing, primarily due to advancements in medical technology, improved healthcare access, better nutrition, and public health initiatives. However, the rate of increase in maximum lifespan has not kept pace with the increase in average lifespan.

3. **Demographic Data**: The global population is aging. The United Nations projects that the number of people aged 100 and over will increase significantly. By 2100, it is estimated that there could be over 3 million centenarians worldwide.

### Expert Opinions
1. **Gerontology Experts**: Many gerontologists believe that while average lifespans may continue to rise, the maximum human lifespan may remain relatively stable. Some experts argue that there are biological limits to human longevity, suggesting that reaching ages beyond 120 may be exceedingly rare.

2. **Advancements in Science**: Ongoing research in genetics, biotechnology, and regenerative medicine could potentially extend human lifespan. However, these advancements are still in early stages, and their impact on longevity by 2100 remains uncertain.

### Consensus Views
1. **Historical Maximum Lifespan**: The consensus among demographers and gerontologists is that while more individuals may reach extreme old age, the likelihood of someone surpassing the current record of 122 years is low. The upper limit of human lifespan has remained relatively unchanged for decades.

2. **Guinness World Records Criteria**: For the age of the oldest human to be officially recognized by Guinness, the individual must be verified through rigorous documentation, including birth certificates and other official records.

### Missing Factors
1. **Health Crises and Pandemics**: Unforeseen health crises, such as pandemics, could impact longevity trends. The COVID-19 pandemic has already shown how such events can affect life expectancy.

2. **Social and Economic Factors**: Changes in healthcare access, socioeconomic status, and lifestyle choices will also play a significant role in determining who lives to extreme ages by 2100.

### Bayesian Updating Considerations
- **Base Rates**: Historically, the maximum age reached by verified individuals has not exceeded 122 years. This base rate suggests that while there may be more centenarians, breaking the record may be unlikely.
- **Probabilities of Extreme Longevity**: If new scientific breakthroughs occur, this could shift the probabilities, but current evidence does not strongly support the likelihood of surpassing the existing record.

### Conclusion
Given the current information and trends, it is reasonable to conclude that while the number of centenarians will likely increase, the age of the oldest human as of 2100, according to the Guinness World Records, will likely not exceed 122 years. Thus, based on current evidence, the resolution of the question would lean towards **No**, as it is unlikely that anyone will surpass the age of 122 by 2100. However, this conclusion is contingent on the absence of significant breakthroughs in longevity science.

Reasoning from forecaster1 for URL dummy://test.com: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is 75 years (2100 - 2025).

(b) The outcome if nothing changed would be 122 years, as this is the current record for the oldest verified age.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued would likely be slightly above 122, but not significantly higher, given the slow increase in maximum lifespan compared to average lifespan.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets generally suggest that while average lifespans may increase, the maximum lifespan may not see a substantial increase. Many experts believe biological limits could cap maximum age close to the current record.

(e) An unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome could involve widespread health crises or pandemics that significantly reduce the population of individuals reaching extreme old age.

(f) An unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome could involve breakthroughs in anti-aging technologies or regenerative medicine that dramatically extend human lifespan beyond current expectations.

Given these considerations, I will provide a forecast with a wide range to account for uncertainties:

Reasoning from forecaster2 for URL dummy://test.com: ### (a) Time left until the outcome is known  
The outcome will be known by 2100-12-31. From today (2025-09-18), this is **75 years and 3 months**.  

### (b) Outcome if nothing changed  
If no advancements in medicine, healthcare, or lifestyle occur, and trends remain static, the oldest human age would likely remain near the current record of **122 years**.  

### (c) Outcome if the current trend continued  
Current trends suggest gradual increases in average lifespan but slower growth in maximum lifespan. The number of centenarians is rising, but the upper limit has not shifted significantly. The oldest human age might reach **123-125 years** by 2100.  

### (d) Expectations of experts and markets  
- **Experts**: Most gerontologists and demographers believe the maximum human lifespan is unlikely to exceed 125 years without breakthroughs. The consensus leans toward **120-125 years**.  
- **Markets**: Longevity-focused investments (e.g., anti-aging research) are growing, but market expectations are not pricing in radical lifespan extensions (>130 years) by 2100.  

### (e) Unexpected low outcome scenario  
A global health catastrophe (e.g., a deadlier pandemic, nuclear war, or environmental collapse) could reduce lifespans, limiting the oldest human to **100-110 years** by 2100.  

### (f) Unexpected high outcome scenario  
Breakthroughs in genetic engineering, senescence reversal, or artificial organ replacement could push the maximum lifespan beyond biological limits, reaching **140-150 years** or higher.  

### Final Answer  
Anchoring to the historical record (122 years) and incorporating conservative expert views with potential upside from technological advances, the 90/10 confidence intervals are:  

- Percentile 10: 115 years (low-end outlier: societal collapse, no progress)  
- Percentile 20: 120 years (current record barely surpassed)  
- Percentile 40: 122 years (status quo persists)  
- Percentile 60: 125 years (modest progress)  
- Percentile 80: 130 years (significant medical advances)  
- Percentile 90: 140 years (transformative breakthroughs)  

This reflects a right-skewed distribution, acknowledging the low probability but high impact of longevity science breakthroughs.

Reasoning from forecaster2 for URL dummy://test.com: ### (a) Time Left Until the Outcome is Known  
The outcome will be known by 2100-12-31. As of 2025-09-18, there are **75 years and 3 months** until the answer is determined.

### (b) Outcome if Nothing Changed  
If no significant advancements in medicine, healthcare, or longevity science occur, and current trends persist, the oldest human age would likely remain near the current record of **122 years**. Historical data suggests this is a hard biological limit under present conditions.

### (c) Outcome if Current Trends Continued  
With gradual improvements in healthcare and lifestyle (e.g., reduced smoking, better disease management), the number of centenarians would rise, but the maximum lifespan might only incrementally increase. Projecting linearly, the oldest age might reach **125 years** by 2100.

### (d) Expectations of Experts and Markets  
- **Experts**: Most gerontologists and demographers believe the maximum lifespan will not exceed **125 years** without radical breakthroughs. The consensus upper bound is **122–130 years**.  
- **Markets**: Longevity-focused investments (e.g., anti-aging biotech) imply some optimism, but no market instruments currently price a significant probability of ages beyond **130 years**.

### (e) Unexpected Low Outcome (<122 years)  
A global health catastrophe (e.g., multi-drug-resistant pandemics, nuclear war, or climate-driven famines) could reduce lifespans, reverting the record to **110–115 years** due to systemic collapse of healthcare infrastructure.

### (f) Unexpected High Outcome (>130 years)  
A "longevity escape velocity" scenario where breakthroughs in gene therapy, senolytics, or AI-driven personalized medicine delay aging processes could push the record to **140–150 years**. This would require scientific leaps far beyond current projections.

### Final Answer  
Anchoring to the base rate (122 years) and adjusting for trends and uncertainty, the 90/10 confidence intervals are:  
- **Percentile 10**: 118 years (accounting for potential setbacks)  
- **Percentile 20**: 120 years (modest decline from current record)  
- **Percentile 40**: 122 years (status quo)  
- **Percentile 60**: 125 years (moderate progress)  
- **Percentile 80**: 130 years (accelerated advancements)  
- **Percentile 90**: 135 years (breakthrough-driven outlier)  

*Note: Intervals reflect the high uncertainty over 75 years, with a conservative skew due to biological limits and a long right tail for disruptive innovation.*

Reasoning from forecaster3 for URL dummy://test.com: (a) Time left until the outcome is known: 75 years and 3½ months (from 18 Sep 2025 to 1 Jan 2100).

(b) Outcome if nothing changed: 122 years – the verified record would still stand.

(c) Outcome if the current trend continued: the trend is that the *number* of centenarians rises, but the *maximum* has plateaued since 1997. A straight-line extrapolation of the post-1997 maximum gives ≈ 123–124 years by 2100.

(d) Expectations of experts and markets: gerontology surveys (Vijg 2014, Dong et al 2016, NIH workshop 2020) cluster around 120-125 years as a “soft” biological ceiling; no credible market or expert survey puts the 2100 record above 130 years. Longevity-boosting start-ups advertise bigger numbers, but these are marketing, not peer-reviewed science.

(e) Unexpected low-outcome scenario (≈ 100-110 y): a global resurgence of antibiotic-resistant tuberculosis or a synthetic-pathogen bioterror event kills most ultra-octogenarians, documentation standards tighten, and the oldest verified person in 2100 is only ~105 years old.

(f) Unexpected high-outcome scenario (≈ 160-180 y): CRISPR-based germline repair, partial epigenetic reprogramming, and nanoscale organ refurbishment enter routine clinical use by 2060, producing a small cohort of “validated 150-year-olds”; one lucky individual with exceptionally protective genetics reaches ~175 years before 2100.

Anchoring on the 122-year base rate, I blend:
- 60 % weight to the outside-view plateau (mode ~123 y)
- 25 % weight to moderate biotech upside (tail to 150 y)
- 10 % weight to radical tech upside (tail to 180 y)
- 5 % weight to downward shocks (floor ~105 y)

This yields a wide, right-skewed distribution that stays humble about unknown unknowns.

Reasoning from forecaster4 for URL dummy://test.com: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 75 years (from 2025 to 2100).

(b) The outcome if nothing changed would likely remain at the current record of 122 years, as Jeanne Calment's record has stood for decades without being surpassed.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued might see a slight increase, but given the historical stability of the maximum lifespan, it might not exceed 123-125 years.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets generally align with the notion that while average lifespans will increase, the maximum human lifespan may not see a significant increase beyond the current record due to biological limits.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome could be a global health crisis or pandemic that significantly impacts life expectancy and longevity, reducing the potential for individuals to reach extreme ages.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome could involve revolutionary advancements in biotechnology or genetic engineering that significantly extend human lifespan, allowing individuals to surpass the current record by a substantial margin.

Given these considerations, I will provide a forecast with wide confidence intervals to account for uncertainty and unknown factors:

Synthesized reasoning (using openrouter/openai/gpt-4o) for URL dummy://test.com: To synthesize a final balanced distribution from the forecasts provided by the four forecasters, we need to consider the commonalities and differences in their predictions and reasoning.

### Commonalities:
1. **Base Rate:** All forecasters agree that the current record of 122 years is a significant anchor, with little expectation for drastic changes without major breakthroughs.
2. **Current Trends:** There is consensus that incremental improvements might lead to a slight increase in maximum age, with estimates generally clustering around 123-125 years.
3. **Expert Expectations:** Forecasters align on the view that experts expect the maximum lifespan to remain close to current records, with a potential ceiling around 130 years unless significant technological advancements occur.

### Differences:
1. **Low Outcome Scenarios:** Forecaster 3 presents a more pessimistic view with a lower bound of 105 years, considering severe global health crises.
2. **High Outcome Scenarios:** Forecaster 3 also presents a much higher potential outcome of 165 years, considering radical technological advancements, while others are more conservative, capping at 135-150 years.

### Heuristics for Synthesis:
- **Base Rates:** The historical record of 122 years should heavily influence the lower percentiles.
- **Bayesian Updates:** Incorporate the potential for incremental improvements and expert consensus, suggesting modest increases in the middle percentiles.
- **Wide Intervals:** Given the uncertainty over 75 years, a wider range is prudent, especially in higher percentiles to account for potential breakthroughs.
- **Bias Avoidance:** Avoid overemphasizing extreme scenarios without strong evidence.

### Final Synthesized Percentiles:
- **Percentile 10:** 120 (acknowledging potential setbacks but not as low as Forecaster 3's extreme scenario)
- **Percentile 20:** 122 (aligning with the current record and base rate)
- **Percentile 40:** 124 (reflecting modest improvements in healthcare and longevity)
- **Percentile 60:** 127 (considering moderate advancements and expert expectations)
- **Percentile 80:** 135 (accounting for potential breakthroughs in biotechnology)
- **Percentile 90:** 150 (allowing for radical advancements, but more conservative than Forecaster 3's extreme high)

Final percentiles:
Percentile 10: 120
Percentile 20: 122
Percentile 40: 124
Percentile 60: 127
Percentile 80: 135
