# GitHub Actions Tournament Integration - COMPLETE ‚úÖ

## Summary

Successfully configured GitHub Actions to run the forecasting bot with **all 7 tournaments** including the most recently added Kiko Llaneras Tournament.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Tournament Mode Bug Fix
- **Issue**: `kiko_reports` and `market_pulse_reports` were missing from final `forecast_reports` aggregation
- **Fix**: Updated line 1895 in `main.py` to include all 7 tournament reports:
  ```python
  forecast_reports = seasonal_tournament_reports + minibench_reports + fall_aib_reports + potus_reports + rand_reports + market_pulse_reports + kiko_reports
  ```

### 2. GitHub Actions Workflows

#### New Scheduled Tournament Workflow
- **File**: `.github/workflows/tournament_scheduled.yaml`
- **Schedule**: Every 20 minutes (cron: `*/20 * * * *`)
- **Features**:
  - Uses Poetry for proper dependency management
  - Processes all 7 tournaments
  - Comprehensive environment validation
  - Artifact upload for logs
  - Detailed workflow summary

#### Tournament Integration Test Workflow
- **File**: `.github/workflows/test_tournament_integration.yaml`
- **Triggers**: On push to main (when main.py changes) or manual dispatch
- **Tests**:
  - All 7 tournament question variables present
  - All tournament report variables included in aggregation
  - Complete tournament logging
  - Python syntax validation

## Tournament Coverage

The bot now forecasts on **7 tournaments**:

1. **AI Competition** (`CURRENT_AI_COMPETITION_ID: 32813`)
2. **MiniBench** (`CURRENT_MINIBENCH_ID: minibench`)
3. **Fall AIB 2025** (slug: `fall-aib-2025`)
4. **POTUS Predictions** (slug: `POTUS-predictions`)
5. **RAND Policy Challenge** (slug: `rand`)
6. **Market Pulse Challenge 25Q4** (slug: `market-pulse-25q4`)
7. **Kiko Llaneras Tournament** (community: `kiko`) ‚≠ê **NEWLY INTEGRATED**

## Technical Details

### Kiko Tournament Detection
The bot uses **3 detection methods** for Kiko questions:
1. **Community-based**: `q.community.slug == 'kiko'`
2. **Community slug fallback**: `q.community_slug == 'kiko'`
3. **Keyword detection**: ['Kiko Llaneras', 'Llaneras', 'Kiko']

### LLM Configuration
- **4-model ensemble** with fallback system
- **Fallback LLM system** for reliability
- **Rate limiting** with `_llm_rate_limiter`
- **Error handling** with graceful fallbacks

### Workflow Features
- **Poetry dependency management** for reliable package installation
- **Environment validation** to ensure all secrets are available
- **Artifact uploads** for log retention
- **Comprehensive logging** with tournament-specific counts
- **NTFY alerts** for new questions and bot status

## Verification

### Local Integration Test
```bash
python3 verify_tournament_integration.py
# Result: ‚úÖ PASS - All 7 tournaments properly integrated
```
