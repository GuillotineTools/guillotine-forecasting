Found Research for URL dummy://test.com:
To assess the question of what the age of the oldest human will be as of 2100, we need to consider several factors, including current records, trends in human longevity, and expert opinions.

### Current Record
As of October 2023, the oldest verified person is María Branyas Morera, born on March 4, 1907, making her 116 years old. The Guinness World Records recognizes her as the oldest living person. The record for the oldest verified age is currently held by Jeanne Calment, who lived to be 122 years and 164 days, passing away in 1997.

### Trends in Longevity
1. **Advancements in Healthcare**: There have been significant advancements in healthcare, nutrition, and lifestyle that contribute to increased life expectancy. However, the rate of increase in maximum lifespan has not kept pace with average life expectancy improvements.
   
2. **Maximum Lifespan**: Research suggests that while average life expectancy may continue to rise, the maximum lifespan (the age of the oldest individuals) has remained relatively stable. The consensus among gerontologists is that the maximum human lifespan is around 120-125 years.

3. **Demographic Trends**: The population of centenarians (people aged 100 and older) is increasing, but the number of supercentenarians (people aged 110 and older) remains small. The growth in this demographic may not necessarily indicate a significant increase in the maximum age.

### Expert Opinions
- **Gerontologists**: Many experts believe that while we may see more people living into their 100s, the record for the oldest human will likely not exceed Jeanne Calment's age of 122 years. Some researchers argue that biological limits may prevent humans from living significantly longer than this.
  
- **Longevity Research**: Studies on aging suggest that while interventions may extend lifespan, they may not necessarily push the boundaries of maximum age. The biological mechanisms of aging impose limits that are not yet fully understood.

### Missing Factors
- **Genetic Factors**: Genetic predisposition plays a significant role in longevity, and future breakthroughs in genetics could potentially alter the landscape of human lifespan.
  
- **Environmental Factors**: Changes in lifestyle, diet, and environmental conditions could also impact longevity in unforeseen ways.

### Conclusion
Based on the current information and expert consensus, it is likely that the age of the oldest human as of 2100 will not exceed 122 years. Therefore, the resolution of the question, based on the criteria of the official Guinness record, would likely be **No**, as it is improbable that anyone will surpass Jeanne Calment's record by that time. 

### Summary
- Current oldest verified person: María Branyas Morera (116 years).
- Record for oldest age: Jeanne Calment (122 years).
- Expert consensus suggests maximum lifespan is around 120-125 years.
- Likely resolution: **No**, the age of the oldest human as of 2100 will not exceed 122 years.

Reasoning from forecaster2 for URL dummy://test.com: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 75 years, as we are currently in 2025 and the year in question is 2100.

(b) If nothing changed, we would expect the oldest human to remain around the current record of 122 years, as there have been no significant advancements in longevity that would suggest a higher age.

(c) If the current trend of gradual increases in life expectancy continues, we might see a slight increase in the age of the oldest human, but it is unlikely to exceed 125 years, as the maximum lifespan has historically remained stable.

(d) Expert opinions generally suggest that while more people may live into their 100s, the record for the oldest human is unlikely to surpass 122 years. The consensus is that biological limits will likely prevent significant increases in maximum lifespan.

(e) An unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome could be a global health crisis or a significant decline in healthcare quality, leading to a decrease in life expectancy and a lower maximum age for the oldest human.

(f) An unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome could involve groundbreaking advancements in genetic engineering or anti-aging therapies that significantly extend human lifespan, allowing individuals to live well beyond the current record.

Considering these factors and the expert consensus, I will provide a wide range of estimates to account for uncertainty:

Percentile 10: 110  
Percentile 20: 115  
Percentile 40: 120  
Percentile 60: 122  
Percentile 80: 125  
Percentile 90: 130  

This distribution reflects the belief that while the maximum age may not change significantly, there is still a possibility for unexpected advancements that could push the boundaries of human longevity. 

Final answer:

Percentile 10: 110
Percentile 20: 115
Percentile 40: 120
Percentile 60: 122
Percentile 80: 125

Reasoning from forecaster3 for URL dummy://test.com: ### (a) Time Left Until the Outcome is Known
As of today, September 18, 2025, there are 75 years until the year 2100.

### (b) Outcome if Nothing Changed
If current trends and conditions remain unchanged, the oldest verified age would likely remain around 122 years, as this has been the historical maximum. Therefore, the outcome would be 122 years.

### (c) Outcome if the Current Trend Continued
If advancements in healthcare and lifestyle continue at the current pace, it is plausible that the oldest human could reach an age slightly above 122 years, but likely not exceeding 125 years. Thus, a reasonable estimate would be around 123 years.

### (d) Expectations of Experts and Markets
Experts generally agree that while average life expectancy may continue to rise, the maximum lifespan is likely capped around 120-125 years. The consensus suggests that it is improbable for anyone to surpass Jeanne Calment's record of 122 years. Therefore, the expected outcome aligns closely with the current record, likely around 122-125 years.

### (e) Unexpected Scenario Resulting in a Low Outcome
An unexpected scenario that could lead to a lower outcome might involve a global health crisis or a significant decline in healthcare quality, leading to increased mortality rates among the elderly. This could result in fewer individuals reaching advanced ages, potentially capping the oldest age at around 120 years.

### (f) Unexpected Scenario Resulting in a High Outcome
Conversely, an unexpected scenario that could lead to a higher outcome might involve groundbreaking advancements in genetic engineering or anti-aging therapies that significantly extend human lifespan. If such technologies become widely available and effective, it could allow individuals to live well beyond 125 years, potentially reaching ages of 130 or more.

### Final Answer
Taking into account the current consensus, trends, and potential unexpected scenarios, I will provide a wide range of estimates to reflect the uncertainty involved:
