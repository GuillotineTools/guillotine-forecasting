To assess the question of what the age of the oldest human will be as of 2100, we need to consider several factors, including current records, trends in human longevity, and expert opinions.

### Current Record
As of October 2023, the oldest verified person is María Branyas Morera, who was born on March 4, 1907, making her 116 years old. The Guinness World Records recognizes her as the oldest living person. The current record for the oldest verified age is 122 years, held by Jeanne Calment, who lived from 1875 to 1997.

### Trends in Longevity
1. **Advancements in Healthcare**: There have been significant advancements in healthcare, nutrition, and lifestyle that contribute to increased life expectancy. However, the rate of increase in maximum lifespan has not kept pace with average life expectancy improvements.
   
2. **Maximum Lifespan**: The maximum human lifespan appears to be biologically constrained. While some researchers argue that it may be possible to extend this limit through genetic and technological interventions, others believe that the maximum age will remain around 120-125 years.

3. **Demographic Trends**: The global population is aging, and the number of centenarians is increasing. However, the number of supercentenarians (people aged 110 and older) remains relatively small.

### Expert Opinions
- **Gerontologists**: Many experts in aging suggest that while average life expectancy may continue to rise, the maximum lifespan is unlikely to exceed 120-125 years in the near future. Some researchers, like Dr. David Sinclair, advocate for the potential of biotechnology to extend life, but consensus remains cautious.
  
- **Longevity Research**: Studies indicate that while interventions may improve healthspan (the period of life spent in good health), they may not significantly extend lifespan beyond current records.

### Base Rates and Consensus Views
- Historically, the oldest verified age has not exceeded 122 years. The consensus among gerontologists is that while life expectancy may rise, the record for the oldest human is unlikely to surpass 125 years by 2100.
  
- The current trajectory suggests that while more people may live to be over 100, the number of individuals reaching supercentenarian status will remain limited.

### Missing Factors
- **Technological Breakthroughs**: Future advancements in biotechnology, genetics, and medicine could potentially alter the landscape of human longevity, but predicting such breakthroughs is inherently uncertain.
  
- **Environmental Factors**: Changes in global health, climate, and lifestyle could impact longevity trends in unpredictable ways.

### Conclusion
Based on current information, the age of the oldest human as of 2100 is likely to be around the historical maximum of 120-125 years, with a low probability of exceeding this range. Therefore, the resolution of the question will likely be "No" if it refers to surpassing the current record of 122 years. However, if the question is about the age of the oldest verified human, it could be "Yes" if a new record is established within that range. 

In summary, while there is potential for new records, the consensus suggests that the age of the oldest human will not exceed 125 years by 2100, making a definitive "No" more likely based on current evidence.

Reasoning from forecaster3 for URL dummy://test.com: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: 75 years (from 2025 to 2100).

(b) The outcome if nothing changed: 122 years (current verified record held by Jeanne Calment, unchanged since 1997).

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: Approximately 123–125 years. While average life expectancy continues to rise globally, the maximum verified age has plateaued near 122 since the 1990s, with only marginal increases in supercentenarian survival (e.g., more individuals reaching 115–119, but not consistently surpassing 122).

(d) The expectations of experts and markets: Most gerontologists and demographers believe the biological limit for human lifespan is around 120–125 years. Markets (e.g., longevity biotech investments) are optimistic about healthspan extension but cautious about significant lifespan breakthroughs. Expert consensus assigns low probability to exceeding 130 by 2100, with moderate probability of minor record-breaking (e.g., 123–126).

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: A global catastrophe — such as a prolonged climate collapse, nuclear conflict, or engineered pandemic — severely disrupts healthcare systems, nutrition, and scientific progress. Longevity research stalls or reverses, and global life expectancy declines. The oldest verified person in 2100 is only 110 due to systemic collapse.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: A convergence of breakthroughs — e.g., CRISPR-based aging reversal, senolytic therapies, AI-designed personalized medicine, and epigenetic reprogramming — leads to radical life extension. A person born in the 2040s benefits from these therapies starting in midlife and reaches 150+ by 2100. Verification systems (e.g., blockchain birth records, global longevity registries) confirm the age, making it the new Guinness record.

The consensus view is that the age of the oldest human will remain around the current record of 122 years.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: A global health crisis or significant environmental degradation could lead to a decrease in overall life expectancy and limit the maximum age achieved by humans. This could result in the oldest human age being lower than expected, possibly around 110-115 years.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: A groundbreaking advancement in biotechnology, such as the discovery of a "longevity gene" or a revolutionary medical treatment, could significantly extend human lifespan. This could lead to the oldest human age exceeding current expectations, possibly reaching 130-140 years.

**Rationale:**  
- **Base rate**: The current verified record is 122 years (Jeanne Calment). Historical trends and expert consensus suggest a biological limit near 120-125 years.  
- **Conservative outlook (10th-60th percentiles)**: Anchored to the current record and incremental medical progress, with modest extensions to ~125 years.  
- **Optimistic scenarios (80th-90th percentiles)**: Accounts for potential breakthroughs in biotechnology (e.g., senolytics, gene editing) or delayed aging processes, pushing the upper bound to 130-140 years.  
- **Constraints**: The 200-year cap is treated as a theoretical upper limit, but realistic projections align with gradual advancements rather than radical lifespan extension.

Reasoning from forecaster3 for URL dummy://test.com: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: 75 years (from 2025 to 2100).

(b) The outcome if nothing changed: 122 years (current verified record by Jeanne Calment, unchanged since 1997).

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: Approximately 125 years — based on the slow creep of supercentenarian records (e.g., 119 in 2020s, 120–122 occasionally verified), assuming linear progress of ~0.04 years/year, yielding ~3 additional years by 2100.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets: Most gerontologists and demographers expect maximum lifespan to plateau between 120–125 years by 2100. Markets (e.g., longevity biotech investments) are more optimistic, pricing in potential breakthroughs, but lack consensus on human trials or regulatory approval for radical life extension before late 21st century. No formal prediction markets exist for this specific question, but expert surveys (e.g., Pew, Max Planck Institute) suggest median expectation of 124, with few expecting >130.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: Global collapse due to climate catastrophe, nuclear war, or engineered pandemic reduces global healthcare capacity and life expectancy. Supercentenarians become statistically impossible due to systemic collapse in elder care, nutrition, or medical infrastructure. Record stagnates at 122 or even drops if verification systems fail.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: Breakthroughs in epigenetic reprogramming, senolytics, and AI-driven personalized medicine enable radical lifespan extension. First “escape velocity” humans (those gaining >1 year of life expectancy per year) emerge in the 2040s–2060s. A person born in the 2030s reaches 160+ by 2100 due to compounded biological age reversal. Verification systems adapt to confirm ages previously thought impossible.

Reasoning from forecaster3 for URL dummy://test.com: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: 75 years (from 2025 to 2100).

(b) The outcome if nothing changed: 122 years — the current verified record set by Jeanne Calment in 1997 has not been broken in over 25 years, and if no medical, technological, or societal changes occur, it may stand.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: 125–128 years — modest increases in supercentenarian verification, slight gains in geriatric care, and more global record-keeping may allow 1–3 additional years beyond Calment’s record by 2100, but no exponential leap.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets: Most gerontologists and demographic experts believe the biological limit is near 120–125 years. Markets (e.g., longevity biotech investments) are optimistic about healthspan extension but not necessarily maximum lifespan breakthroughs. No major prediction market currently prices in >130 years as likely by 2100.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: Global collapse due to climate catastrophe, nuclear war, or engineered pandemics disrupts medical infrastructure and nutrition systems, causing life expectancy to plummet and preventing anyone from approaching current records — oldest verified human in 2100 is 105–110 due to societal regression.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: Breakthroughs in epigenetic reprogramming, senolytics, and AI-driven personalized medicine allow some individuals to dramatically slow or reverse aging. A person born in the 2040s or 2050s enters a “longevity escape velocity” and reaches 150+ by 2100, verified under strict Guinness protocols.

Reasoning from forecaster5 for URL dummy://test.com: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: Approximately 75 years (from 2025 to 2100).  

(b) The outcome if nothing changed: 122 years. If medical advancements stall and no individual exceeds the current verified maximum lifespan of 122 years (held by Jeanne Calment), the record would remain unchanged by 2100.  

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: 122–125 years. Historical data shows maximum lifespan has plateaued around 120–125 years despite rising average life expectancy. Continuing this trend, the oldest human by 2100 would likely reach the upper end of this range but not exceed it significantly.  

(d) The expectations of experts and markets: Most gerontologists and longevity researchers predict the maximum lifespan by 2100 will stay within 120–125 years. There are no formal financial markets for this outcome, but expert consensus leans toward modest increases (if any) from the current 122-year record, with >70% assigning low probability to exceeding 125 years.  

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: A global health crisis (e.g., a highly contagious pathogen targeting elderly populations, or widespread collapse of healthcare systems in aging populations) could drastically reduce the number of supercentenarians. For example, a pandemic that kills 90% of people over 105 would leave the oldest human in 2100 aged ~115 years.  

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: A breakthrough in anti-aging biotechnology—such as a drug that reverses cellular senescence or edits genes linked to aging—could extend healthy lifespan by 20+ years. If such a treatment is developed and widely accessible by 2050, an individual might live to 140–150 years, making the oldest human in 2100 ~130–140 years old.

Reasoning from forecaster6 for URL dummy://test.com:  (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: 75 years (from 2025 to 2100).

(b) The outcome if nothing changed: Approximately 122 years, assuming no significant changes in human longevity and no individual surpasses Jeanne Calment's record.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: Given the slow rate of increase in maximum lifespan and the biological constraints that may limit it, the outcome could be around 120-125 years. This assumes that the current trend of modest increases in the maximum age of humans continues without any major breakthroughs.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets: Experts generally agree that while average life expectancy may increase, the maximum lifespan is unlikely to exceed 125 years by 2100. Therefore, the expectations might be around 120-125 years, with a low probability of a significant increase beyond this range.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: An unexpected global health crisis, such as a pandemic more severe than COVID-19, could lead to a decrease in life expectancy due to increased mortality rates and strained healthcare systems. This could result in fewer people reaching extreme old age, potentially keeping the maximum lifespan around the current record of 122 years or even lower.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: A breakthrough in anti-aging medicine, such as the development of effective senolytic therapies or genetic interventions that significantly delay aging, could extend the maximum human lifespan beyond current expectations. If such treatments were widely available and effective, the oldest human by 2100 could potentially reach ages well beyond 125 years, possibly approaching 150 years or more.

Given the uncertainty and the potential for unforeseen developments in the field of longevity research, a humble and wide confidence interval is warranted. Here are the percentiles for the age of the oldest human as of 2100:

"
Percentile 10: 120
Percentile 20: 122
Percentile 40: 125
Percentile 60: 130
Percentile 80: 140
Percentile 90: 150
"

This distribution reflects the current consensus and trends while allowing for the possibility of significant breakthroughs in longevity research. It also accounts for the potential impact of unforeseen negative events on human lifespan.

Reasoning from forecaster6 for URL dummy://test.com:  (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known:
The year 2100 is 75 years away from the current date of 2025-09-10. This is a significant amount of time for advancements in medicine and changes in environmental and lifestyle factors that could impact human longevity.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed:
If we assume that no significant advancements in extending human lifespan occur, the age of the oldest human by 2100 would likely remain around the current maximum of 122 years, as established by Jeanne Calment.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued:
The current trend in healthcare and technology suggests a gradual increase in average life expectancy, but the maximum lifespan has not shown a similar rate of increase. If this trend continues, we might see more individuals reaching the age of 100, but the maximum lifespan may only increase slightly, perhaps to 125-130 years by 2100.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets:
Experts in gerontology generally agree that while average life expectancy will likely continue to rise, the maximum human lifespan will remain constrained, possibly reaching up to 125 years. The markets for anti-aging products and longevity research reflect optimism about extending healthspan, but there is less confidence in significantly extending lifespan beyond the current record.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome:
An unexpected global health crisis, such as a pandemic more severe than COVID-19, could lead to widespread economic downturns, reduced access to healthcare, and a decrease in life expectancy. This could result in fewer people reaching extreme old age, and the maximum lifespan might remain at or below the current record of 122 years.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome:
A breakthrough in genetic engineering, regenerative medicine, or biotechnology could lead to a significant extension of the human lifespan. For example, the discovery of a way to safely and effectively reverse aging at the cellular level could result in a substantial increase in maximum lifespan, potentially exceeding 150 years.

Given the wide range of uncertainties and the potential for both unexpected setbacks and breakthroughs, the forecast for the age of the oldest human by 2100 should reflect a broad distribution:

"
Percentile 10: 110
Percentile 20: 115
Percentile 40: 120
Percentile 60: 125
Percentile 80: 130
Percentile 90: 140
"

This distribution accounts for the possibility of stagnation or regression in longevity research (10th percentile), the current trend and expert consensus (40th percentile), and the potential for significant breakthroughs (80th and 90th percentiles). It also reflects the humility required in forecasting, acknowledging the wide range of possible outcomes over such a long timespan.

Reasoning from forecaster5 for URL dummy://test.com: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 75 years (from 2025 to 2100).  

(b) The outcome if nothing changed is 122 years, as the current verified maximum lifespan (Jeanne Calment) would remain unbroken without new advancements or individuals exceeding it.  

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued is around 123–124 years. Historical maximum lifespan has risen only slightly (from ~115 in the 19th century to 122 today), so a modest, incremental increase is consistent with the slow trend of supercentenarian records.  

(d) The expectations of experts and markets are centered on 120–125 years. Gerontologists and longevity researchers widely consensus that biological constraints (e.g., telomere shortening, senescence) limit maximum lifespan to this range in the near future, with little confidence in exceeding 125 without radical breakthroughs.  

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: A global health crisis (e.g., a novel pathogen with high mortality among older adults, or widespread collapse of healthcare systems in aging populations) could drastically reduce the number of supercentenarians, leaving the oldest human in 2100 at ~120 years—below the current record but still above the 100-year floor.  

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: A breakthrough in anti-aging biotechnology (e.g., safe, widespread use of senolytics to clear aging cells, or CRISPR-based telomere elongation) could extend the maximum lifespan for a small subset of individuals, pushing the oldest human to ~130–140 years by 2100—far beyond current biological limits.

Synthesized reasoning (using openai/gpt-4o) for URL dummy://test.com: To synthesize a final balanced distribution, we need to consider the commonalities and differences among the forecasters, applying heuristics such as base rates, expert consensus, and potential for breakthroughs or setbacks.

**Commonalities:**
1. **Base Rate (Current Record):** All forecasters agree that the current record is 122 years, and if nothing changes, this will remain the maximum age.
2. **Incremental Gains:** Most forecasters predict slight increases in maximum age, generally not exceeding 125 years, based on historical trends and expert consensus.
3. **Potential for Breakthroughs:** Several forecasters consider the possibility of significant breakthroughs, which could lead to ages beyond 130 or even 140-150 years.
4. **Low Outcome Scenarios:** All forecasters mention potential global crises that could lower the maximum age, with estimates ranging from 110 to 115 years.

**Disagreements:**
1. **High Outcome Scenarios:** There is variability in how likely forecasters consider radical life extension, with some predicting up to 150 years and others capping at around 130-140 years.
2. **Mid-range Predictions:** There is some variation in the mid-range predictions (percentiles 40 to 60), with estimates spanning from 122 to 130 years.

**Heuristics and Synthesis:**
- **Base Rates and Expert Consensus:** Given the current record and expert consensus, the 40th percentile should be close to the current record (122-125 years).
- **Potential for Breakthroughs:** While breakthroughs are possible, they are speculative. Thus, higher percentiles (80th and 90th) should reflect a cautious optimism, allowing for significant but not extreme increases.
- **Low Outcome Scenarios:** Given the possibility of global crises, the 10th percentile should reflect a conservative estimate, slightly below the current record.

**Final Balanced Distribution:**
Percentile 10: 115  
Percentile 20: 120  
Percentile 40: 123  
Percentile 60: 127  
Percentile 80: 135

Reasoning from forecaster3 for URL dummy://test.com: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: 75 years (from 2025 to 2100).

(b) The outcome if nothing changed: 122 years — the current verified record set by Jeanne Calment in 1997 would remain unbroken, assuming no further longevity breakthroughs or demographic shifts.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: Approximately 124–126 years — modest increases due to incremental medical progress, better global health infrastructure, and growing numbers of supercentenarians, but without radical life extension technologies.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets: Most gerontologists and demographers expect the maximum human lifespan to remain capped around 120–125 years through 2100. Markets in longevity biotech (e.g., companies targeting aging pathways) are optimistic about healthspan extension, but not necessarily about significantly pushing maximum lifespan beyond 130. No major prediction markets currently price in high probabilities for ages over 130 by 2100.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: A global catastrophe — such as a prolonged climate collapse, nuclear conflict, or engineered pandemic — disrupts medical infrastructure, nutrition, and public health systems, causing regression in life expectancy and eliminating the possibility of supercentenarian survival. The oldest person in 2100 might be only 105–110 due to systemic collapse.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: A biomedical “longevity escape velocity” is achieved by the 2070s — combining gene editing (e.g., CRISPR-based telomere or senescence control), nanomedicine, AI-driven personalized rejuvenation therapies, and organ regeneration. The first “150-year-old” is verified in 2098, having benefited from mid-life interventions that slowed or reversed biological aging.

Reasoning from forecaster6 for URL dummy://test.com:  (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known:
As of September 10, 2025, there are 75 years remaining until the year 2100, which is the timeframe in question for the age of the oldest human.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed:
If we assume that no significant advancements in medicine or changes in environmental factors occur, the age of the oldest human would likely remain around the current verified record of 122 years.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued:
Given the current trends in healthcare and longevity research, we might see a modest increase in the maximum lifespan. However, this trend suggests that the age of the oldest human by 2100 would likely be within the range of 120-125 years, not significantly exceeding the current record.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets:
Experts in gerontology generally agree that while average life expectancy may continue to rise, the maximum lifespan is unlikely to exceed 125 years by 2100. The market for anti-aging treatments and longevity research is growing, but the consensus is cautious about the prospects of significantly extending the maximum human lifespan.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome:
An unexpected global health crisis, such as a novel pandemic more severe than COVID-19, could lead to widespread health issues and a decrease in life expectancy. Additionally, if investments in healthcare and research were to drastically decline due to economic downturns or shifts in societal priorities, this could also result in a lower-than-expected maximum lifespan.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome:
A breakthrough in genetic engineering, such as the discovery of a way to halt or reverse the aging process at the cellular level, could dramatically extend human lifespan. If such technologies were developed and made widely available, it could lead to a significant number of individuals living beyond the current maximum lifespan, potentially reaching ages well into the 130s or even higher.

Given the uncertainties and the potential for both unexpected negative and positive events, the forecast should reflect a wide range of possibilities. The base rate suggests that the maximum lifespan is unlikely to change dramatically, but the potential for technological breakthroughs cannot be dismissed. Therefore, the confidence intervals should be wide to account for these unknowns.

Reasoning from forecaster4 for URL dummy://test.com: ### Forecast Analysis

#### (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.
75 years (from 2025 to 2100).

#### (b) The outcome if nothing changed.
If the current record of 122 years remained unchanged, the age of the oldest human as of 2100 would be 122 years.

#### (c) The outcome if the current trend continued.
Given the trends in healthcare and longevity, if the current trend continued, the age of the oldest human might marginally increase but is unlikely to exceed 125 years significantly.

#### (d) The expectations of experts and markets.
Most gerontologists and longevity researchers expect that while average life expectancy will continue to rise, the maximum human lifespan is likely to remain around 120-125 years by 2100. Some experts are cautiously optimistic about the potential of biotechnology and genetic interventions to extend life, but consensus remains cautious.

#### (e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome.
An unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome could be a global health crisis, environmental catastrophe, or significant deterioration in healthcare systems that reverses current longevity trends. For example, a widespread pandemic or climate-related disasters could lead to reduced life expectancy.

Reasoning from forecaster5 for URL dummy://test.com: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: Approximately 75 years (from September 10, 2025, to January 1, 2100).  

(b) The outcome if nothing changed: 122 years. This assumes no new advancements in medicine or healthcare that extend the maximum verified human lifespan beyond Jeanne Calment’s current record of 122 years, and no supercentenarian surpasses this mark by 2100.  

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: 123–124 years. The historical trend for maximum lifespan has been flat (no significant increase since Jeanne Calment in 1997), but slow improvements in healthcare for the oldest-old (e.g., better management of age-related diseases) might push the maximum up slightly, aligning with the lower end of expert projections.  

(d) The expectations of experts and markets: Most gerontologists and longevity researchers project the maximum lifespan by 2100 will range from 120–125 years. There are no mainstream financial markets predicting this, but expert consensus leans toward a ceiling of 125 years, with the most likely outcome clustering around 122–123 years (near the current record).  

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: A global health crisis (e.g., a novel pandemic, widespread antibiotic resistance, or climate-driven diseases) that disproportionately kills supercentenarians (the smallest segment of the population) could stall progress. For example, if a highly contagious disease with high mortality among those over 110 emerges, the maximum lifespan might remain locked at 122 years or even dip slightly (though not below 100, per constraints).  

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: A breakthrough in anti-aging biotechnology—such as widespread use of senolytics (drugs to clear senescent cells), telomere-lengthening therapies, or CRISPR-based repairs to aging-related genes—could dramatically extend healthspan and push the maximum lifespan beyond current limits. For instance, if such interventions are proven safe and effective in humans by 2050, the oldest person in 2100 might reach 130–140 years.

Reasoning from forecaster6 for URL dummy://test.com:  (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known:
As of September 10, 2025, there are 75 years remaining until the year 2100, which is the timeframe in question for the age of the oldest human.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed:
If we assume that no significant advancements in medicine or changes in environmental factors occur, the age of the oldest human would likely remain around the current verified record of 122 years.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued:
Given the slow rate of increase in maximum lifespan and the biological constraints that appear to limit human longevity, even with continued advancements in healthcare and lifestyle improvements, the maximum age may only increase slightly. The oldest human by 2100 might be expected to reach around 125-130 years under this scenario.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets:
Experts in gerontology generally agree that while average life expectancy may continue to rise, the maximum lifespan is unlikely to significantly exceed the current record of 122 years by 2100. The consensus is that the age of the oldest human will likely be within the range of 120-125 years.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome:
An unexpected global health crisis, such as a novel and highly virulent pathogen against which current medical technology is ineffective, could lead to a decrease in life expectancy and reduce the chances of individuals reaching extreme old age. Additionally, a significant decline in healthcare quality due to economic or political upheavals could also result in a lower outcome.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome:
A breakthrough in anti-aging technology, such as the discovery of a way to effectively halt or reverse the aging process at the cellular or genetic level, could dramatically extend the human lifespan. If such technologies were developed and made widely available, it could lead to a substantial increase in the maximum age, potentially exceeding 150 years.

Given the uncertainties and the potential for both unexpected negative and positive events, a humble forecast with wide confidence intervals is warranted:

"
Percentile 10: 110
Percentile 20: 115
Percentile 40: 120
Percentile 60: 125
Percentile 80: 130
Percentile 90: 140
"

This forecast reflects the understanding that while significant breakthroughs could occur, the base rate and expert opinions suggest a more conservative estimate. The 10th percentile reflects a scenario where global health or other factors negatively impact longevity, while the 90th percentile allows for the possibility of transformative advancements in longevity research.

The outcome will be known by the end of the year 2100, which is 75 years from today, 2025-09-10.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed:
If nothing changed from the current understanding and trends, the age of the oldest human would likely remain around the current record of 122 years, given the biological constraints that appear to limit human lifespan.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued:
If the current trend in healthcare and longevity research continues, we might see incremental improvements in average life expectancy, but the maximum lifespan is not expected to increase significantly. Therefore, the age of the oldest human might increase slightly but is unlikely to exceed 125 years.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets:
Experts in gerontology generally agree that while average lifespans may increase, the maximum human lifespan is unlikely to surpass 125 years by 2100. The market for anti-aging products and therapies is growing, but the consensus among scientists is cautious about the possibility of significantly extending the maximum lifespan.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome:
An unexpected global health crisis, such as a new pandemic with a high mortality rate or widespread antibiotic resistance, could reverse the progress made in life expectancy and reduce the potential age of the oldest human by the end of the century.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome:
A breakthrough in biotechnology, such as the development of effective anti-aging treatments that can halt or reverse the aging process, could lead to a significant extension of the human lifespan. If such treatments were widely available and effective, it could result in a substantial increase in the maximum age, potentially beyond 125 years.

Given the uncertainties and the potential for both unexpected negative and positive events, the forecast should reflect a wide range of possible outcomes. The base rate, which is the historical maximum lifespan, should anchor the forecast, with adjustments made for current trends and potential breakthroughs.

2. **High-End Scenarios:** There is a wide range of predictions for high-end scenarios, with some forecasters suggesting up to 160 years.
3. **Distribution Shape:** Some forecasters present a more conservative distribution centered around the current maximum, while others allow for a wider range of outcomes.

**Resolution via Heuristics:**
- **Base Rates:** The base rate of 122 years should anchor the distribution.
- **Bayesian Updates:** Given the slow historical trend, modest updates should be made for incremental improvements.
- **Wide Intervals:** Given the uncertainty over 75 years, wide intervals are justified.
- **Bias Avoidance:** Avoid over-reliance on either extreme scenarios or overly conservative estimates.

**Final Balanced Distribution:**
- **Percentile 10:** 115 (acknowledging potential setbacks but not as low as the most pessimistic forecasts)
- **Percentile 20:** 120 (aligning with the lower end of expert consensus)
- **Percentile 40:** 123 (reflecting slight improvements over the current record)
- **Percentile 60:** 126 (allowing for modest advancements in healthcare and longevity research)
- **Percentile 80:** 132 (considering potential breakthroughs in anti-aging technology)
- **Percentile 90:** 140 (acknowledging the possibility of radical advancements, but not as high as the most optimistic forecasts)

Final percentiles:
Percentile 10: 115  
Percentile 20: 120  
Percentile 40: 123  
Percentile 60: 126  
Percentile 80: 132  
Percentile 90: 140
