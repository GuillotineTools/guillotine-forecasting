To assess the question of what the age of the oldest human will be as of 2100, we need to consider several factors, including current records, trends in human longevity, and expert opinions.

### Current Record
As of October 2023, the oldest verified person is Mar√≠a Branyas Morera, who was born on March 4, 1907, making her 116 years old. The Guinness World Records recognizes her as the oldest living person. The current record for the oldest verified age is 122 years, held by Jeanne Calment, who lived from 1875 to 1997.

### Trends in Longevity
1. **Advancements in Healthcare**: There have been significant advancements in healthcare, nutrition, and lifestyle that contribute to increased life expectancy. However, the rate of increase in maximum lifespan has not kept pace with average life expectancy improvements.
   
2. **Maximum Lifespan**: Research suggests that while average life expectancy may continue to rise, the maximum lifespan (the age of the oldest individuals) may be reaching a biological limit. Some experts argue that the maximum age may not exceed 120-125 years based on current biological understanding.

3. **Demographic Changes**: The global population is aging, and the number of centenarians is increasing. However, the number of supercentenarians (people aged 110 and older) remains relatively small.

### Expert Opinions
- **Gerontologists**: Many gerontologists believe that while we may see more people living into their 100s, the likelihood of someone surpassing the current record of 122 years is low. They cite biological limits and the challenges of extreme old age.
- **Longevity Researchers**: Some researchers are optimistic about breakthroughs in genetics and biotechnology that could extend human lifespan significantly, but these are speculative and not yet realized.

### Consensus Views
- The consensus among experts is that while life expectancy may continue to rise, the age of the oldest verified human is unlikely to exceed 125 years by 2100. The current record of 122 years set by Jeanne Calment remains a significant benchmark.

### Missing Factors
- **Technological Breakthroughs**: Future advancements in medical technology, genetics, and anti-aging research could potentially alter the landscape of human longevity.
- **Environmental Factors**: Changes in lifestyle, diet, and environmental conditions could also impact longevity in unforeseen ways.

### Conclusion
Based on current information, the age of the oldest human as of 2100 is likely to be around the current record of 122 years, with a possibility of reaching up to 125 years if significant breakthroughs occur. However, the consensus suggests that surpassing this age is unlikely. Therefore, the resolution of the question will likely be **No**, as it is improbable that the age of the oldest human will exceed 125 years by 2100 based on current trends and expert opinions.

Reasoning from forecaster1 for URL dummy://test.com: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 75 years, as we are currently in 2025 and the year in question is 2100.

(b) If nothing changed, the outcome would remain at the current record of 122 years, as there have been no significant advancements in longevity or healthcare that would suggest a change.

(c) If the current trend continued, we might expect the age of the oldest human to reach around 125 years by 2100, considering the gradual improvements in healthcare and lifestyle, but still within the limits suggested by experts.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets generally align with the idea that while average life expectancy may rise, the maximum lifespan is likely to remain capped around 120-125 years. Most gerontologists are skeptical about anyone surpassing the current record of 122 years, citing biological limits.

(e) An unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome could be a global health crisis or a significant decline in healthcare quality, leading to increased mortality rates among the elderly. This could result in fewer individuals reaching advanced ages, keeping the oldest age around 110 years.

(f) An unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome could involve groundbreaking advancements in biotechnology or genetic engineering that significantly extend human lifespan. If such technologies become widely available and effective, it could lead to individuals living well beyond the current record, potentially reaching ages of 130 years or more.

Considering all these factors and the wide range of possibilities, I will provide a distribution that reflects the uncertainty and variability in forecasting human longevity.

(b) If nothing changed, the outcome would remain at the current record of 122 years, as there have been no significant advancements or changes in the factors affecting human longevity.

(c) If the current trend continued, considering the gradual improvements in healthcare and lifestyle, the outcome might reach around 125 years, which is a commonly cited upper limit based on expert opinions.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets suggest that while life expectancy may continue to rise, the age of the oldest verified human is unlikely to exceed 125 years by 2100. Most experts believe that surpassing the current record of 122 years is improbable, but some remain cautiously optimistic about potential breakthroughs in longevity research.

(e) An unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome could involve a global health crisis or environmental disaster that significantly impacts human health and longevity, leading to a decrease in the number of supercentenarians and a potential cap on the maximum lifespan.

(f) An unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome could involve groundbreaking advancements in biotechnology and genetics that dramatically extend human lifespan, allowing individuals to live well beyond the current record, potentially reaching ages of 130 years or more.

Considering all these factors, I will provide a wide distribution to account for the uncertainties involved in forecasting human longevity.
