To assess the question of what the age of the oldest human will be as of 2100, we need to consider several factors, including current records, trends in human longevity, and expert opinions.

### Current Record
As of October 2023, the oldest verified person is Mar√≠a Branyas Morera, born on March 4, 1907, making her 116 years old. The Guinness World Records recognizes her as the oldest living person. The record for the oldest verified age is held by Jeanne Calment, who lived to be 122 years and 164 days, passing away in 1997.

### Trends in Longevity
1. **Advancements in Healthcare**: There have been significant advancements in healthcare, nutrition, and lifestyle that contribute to increased life expectancy. However, the rate of increase in maximum lifespan has not kept pace with average life expectancy improvements.
   
2. **Maximum Lifespan**: Research suggests that while average life expectancy may continue to rise, the maximum lifespan (the age of the oldest individuals) has remained relatively stable. The consensus among gerontologists is that the maximum human lifespan is likely capped around 120-125 years.

3. **Demographic Trends**: The population of centenarians (people aged 100 and older) is increasing, but the number of supercentenarians (people aged 110 and older) remains small. The growth in this demographic may not necessarily indicate a significant increase in the maximum age.

### Expert Opinions
- **Gerontologists**: Many experts believe that while we may see more people living into their 100s, the record for the oldest human will not exceed 122-125 years in the near future. Some studies suggest that biological limits may prevent humans from living much longer than this.
- **Genetic Factors**: Genetic predisposition plays a significant role in longevity, and while some individuals may have genes that promote longer life, these are not widespread enough to suggest a dramatic increase in the maximum age.

### Missing Factors
- **Future Medical Breakthroughs**: Potential breakthroughs in biotechnology, genetics, and anti-aging research could alter the landscape of human longevity. However, predicting such breakthroughs is highly uncertain.
- **Environmental Factors**: Changes in lifestyle, diet, and environmental conditions could also impact longevity, but these factors are difficult to quantify and predict.

### Conclusion
Based on current information, the age of the oldest human as of 2100 is likely to be around the historical maximum of 122-125 years, barring any unforeseen medical advancements. The resolution of the question will depend on whether a new record is established that exceeds the current maximum verified age of 122 years. Given the current trends and expert consensus, it is reasonable to conclude that the oldest human will likely not exceed this age by 2100.

**Resolution Criteria**: The question will resolve as "No" if the age of the oldest human does not exceed 122 years by 2100, based on the current understanding of human longevity and the historical record.

Reasoning from forecaster1 for URL dummy://test.com: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: 75 years.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed: 122 years, as this is the current record for the oldest verified age.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: The current trend suggests that while average life expectancy is increasing, the maximum lifespan has remained relatively stable. Therefore, the outcome might be around 122-125 years.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets: Experts generally expect the maximum human lifespan to remain around 120-125 years, with some potential for slight increases due to medical advancements.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: A global catastrophe, such as a pandemic or environmental disaster, significantly reduces life expectancy and impacts the potential for individuals to reach extreme ages.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: Breakthroughs in anti-aging research or biotechnology lead to significant extensions in human lifespan, allowing individuals to live well beyond the current maximum age.

Given the current understanding and trends, the forecast for the age of the oldest human as of 2100 is as follows:

```
Percentile 10: 122
Percentile 20: 123
Percentile 40: 124
Percentile 60: 125
Percentile 80: 130
Percentile 90: 135
```

Reasoning from forecaster1 for URL dummy://test.com: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is 75 years.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed would be 122 years, as this is the current record for the oldest verified age.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued would likely remain around 122-125 years, given the stability in the maximum lifespan despite increases in average life expectancy.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets suggest that the maximum human lifespan is likely capped around 120-125 years, with some potential for slight increases due to medical advancements.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: A global catastrophe, such as a pandemic or environmental disaster, significantly reduces the average and maximum human lifespan, resulting in the oldest human being younger than expected.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: Breakthroughs in anti-aging research or genetic engineering lead to significant extensions in human lifespan, allowing individuals to live well beyond the current maximum age, potentially reaching 130 years or more.

Given the current understanding and trends, I will provide a forecast with a wide confidence interval to account for uncertainties:

Percentile 20: 123
Percentile 40: 124
Percentile 60: 125
