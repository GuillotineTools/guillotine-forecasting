To assess what the age of the oldest human will be as of 2100, we need to examine several factors, including current longevity records, trends in aging and health, scientific advancements, and expert opinions on long-term demographics.

### Current Record
As of October 2023, the oldest verified person on record is Jeanne Calment, who lived to be 122 years and 164 days old. This record remains unbroken for over two decades.

### Aging Trends and Scientific Advances
1. **Biological Aging Research**: Advances in genetics, biotechnology, and geriatrics have introduced potential for extending healthy lifespan. However, while researchers have made strides in understanding aging, practical applications that significantly increase life expectancy are still largely experimental.
  
2. **Population Aging**: The overall global population is aging, with a projected increase in the number of centenarians. By some estimates, the number of people aged 100 and over could reach millions by 2100, which could create more competitive claims for the title of the oldest human.

3. **Longevity Records Reporting**: The verification process for age claims is becoming more rigorous, with organizations like Guinness World Records employing thorough protocols to validate ages.

### Expert Opinions
- **Gerontologists' Views**: Experts are divided. Some predict significant advancements that may help humans live beyond the current record, while others are more skeptical about the biological limits of human lifespan.
  
- **Demographers**: A consistent theme among population experts is that while many people may live longer, this does not necessarily imply that someone will surpass existing age records. Most gerontologists believe the limit to human lifespan is around 120-125 years.

### Consensus Views
The current trend suggests that while more individuals may reach extreme ages due to health improvements and better living conditions, the likelihood of surpassing the current record of 122 years remains uncertain due to biological limits. Many studies indicate maximum human lifespan has likely reached its ceiling.

### Missing Factors
1. **Breakthroughs in Health Science**: Potential breakthroughs in genetics, anti-aging therapies, and regenerative medicine could drastically alter current expectations regarding lifespan.

2. **Global Events**: Factors like pandemics, climate change, nutrition, and healthcare access could disproportionately affect the elderly population by 2100.

3. **Unforeseen Societal Changes**: Shifts in lifestyle, socioeconomic conditions, and ethical issues around enhancement technologies could either positively or negatively impact longevity outcomes.

### Conclusion
Based on current information:
- The oldest verified human age record remains at 122 years.
- There is considerable skepticism about surpassing that age due to biological and health-related constraints.
- While there is potential for life-extending therapies, the historical data and expert consensus lean toward skepticism regarding exceeding the 122-year threshold consistently.

**Resolution: Based on these insights, the question would likely resolve as "No" (the age of the oldest human will not exceed 122 years by 2100), unless new, currently unforeseen advancements dramatically alter lifespan expectations.**

Reasoning from forecaster2 for URL dummy://test.com: (a) The time left until the outcome is known is approximately 75 years (from 2025 to 2100).

(b) The outcome if nothing changed (i.e., no significant medical breakthroughs or changes in aging trends) would likely be around 122 years, as the current record has stood for decades and biological limits suggest a ceiling.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued (modest increases in life expectancy and growing centenarian population) might see a slight increase, potentially reaching 123-125 years, but not dramatically surpassing the current record.

(d) Experts and markets are generally skeptical about significant increases in maximum lifespan. Many gerontologists believe the biological limit is around 120-125 years, and while some optimism exists for future breakthroughs, consensus leans toward the record not being broken by a large margin.

(e) An unexpected low outcome scenario: A global pandemic or environmental catastrophe (e.g., severe climate change impacts) disproportionately affects the elderly, reducing healthcare quality and increasing mortality among the very old, preventing anyone from reaching even 115 years by 2100.

(f) An unexpected high outcome scenario: Rapid breakthroughs in anti-aging therapies (e.g., gene editing, senolytics, or regenerative medicine) successfully reverse aging processes, allowing humans to live significantly longer, potentially reaching 150 years or more by 2100.

Reasoning from forecaster2 for URL dummy://test.com: (a) The time left until the outcome is known: 75 years (from 2025 to 2100).

(b) The outcome if nothing changed: If medical science, healthcare, and lifestyle factors remain at current levels, the maximum human lifespan would likely remain around 122 years, as it has for decades. The biological limit seems to constrain humans to this age.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: Current trends show increasing numbers of centenarians and supercentenarians (110+), but the maximum verified age has not increased since 1997. The trend suggests stagnation around 115-122 years, with no clear upward movement.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets: Most gerontologists and demographers are skeptical about significantly exceeding the current record. Many believe the natural human lifespan limit is 120-125 years. However, some optimistic researchers point to emerging anti-aging technologies that could break this barrier. There is no market for this, but expert consensus leans toward no major increase.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: A global pandemic targeting the elderly, severe climate change impacts reducing healthcare quality, or societal collapse could lower life expectancy, preventing anyone from reaching even 115 years by 2100.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: Breakthroughs in regenerative medicine, gene therapy, or anti-aging treatments (e.g., senolytics, CRISPR) could dramatically extend lifespan, allowing someone to reach 150 years or more by 2100.

Considering the base rate (current record of 122, stagnation for decades), expert skepticism, and potential for breakthroughs, I set a wide distribution. The 10th percentile accounts for worst-case scenarios, while the 90th allows for significant technological progress. The median is slightly above the current record to reflect slow progress.

Reasoning from forecaster2 for URL dummy://test.com: (a) The time left until the outcome is known is 75 years (from 2025 to 2100). This is a very long timeframe, introducing significant uncertainty due to potential scientific breakthroughs, societal changes, and global events.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed (i.e., if medical science, global health, and societal conditions remained largely static from today) would likely be close to the current record of 122 years. The biological limits observed historically would persist, and it is improbable that the record would be significantly broken.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued involves gradual improvements in healthcare, nutrition, and disease prevention. This would lead to more centenarians and supercentenarians, increasing the probability of someone matching or slightly exceeding the current record. However, trends in maximum lifespan have been flat for decades, suggesting only a marginal increase is plausible under a linear projection.

(d) Expert consensus, particularly among gerontologists and demographers, is generally skeptical about a significant extension of the maximum human lifespan. Many believe the natural limit is around 120-125 years. There is no market prediction for this specific outcome, but scientific opinion leans towards the record remaining unbroken or being exceeded by only a small margin without a major paradigm shift in aging research.

(e) An unexpected low outcome scenario: A series of global catastrophes—such as pandemics more severe than COVID-19, widespread famine due to climate change, or large-scale conflicts—could degrade healthcare systems and reduce overall life expectancy. This would lower the chances of anyone reaching extreme ages, potentially keeping the record below 120 years.

(f) An unexpected high outcome scenario: A breakthrough in anti-aging therapeutics, such as effective senolytics, genetic reprogramming, or nanomedicine, could dramatically slow the aging process. If these technologies become widely available and safe, humans might consistently live to 130 or beyond, shattering current records.

Reasoning from forecaster3 for URL dummy://test.com: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: 75 years (from 2025 to 2100).

(b) The outcome if nothing changed: 122.0 years — the current verified record remains unbroken due to biological, verification, and societal constraints.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: 125.0 years — modest gains from improved geriatric care, nutrition, and data verification may allow a few individuals to edge past Calment’s record by small margins, but no radical breakthroughs.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets: Most gerontologists and demographers believe the ceiling is 120–125 years; markets and prediction platforms (e.g. Metaculus) currently assign low probability to anyone living beyond 130 by 2100. Consensus clusters around 122–127.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: A global health catastrophe (e.g., engineered pandemic, climate collapse, nuclear conflict) disproportionately kills the elderly or destabilizes medical infrastructure, preventing anyone from surviving beyond 110–115. Verification systems collapse, and only poorly documented claims survive, leading Guinness to reject all new records.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: A convergence of breakthroughs — gene editing (e.g., CRISPR-based aging reversal), cellular reprogramming (Yamanaka factors), senolytics, and AI-driven personalized medicine — extends biological healthspan dramatically. A person born in the 2030s enters clinical anti-aging trials in their 60s and lives without age-related disease, reaching 145+ by 2100. Guinness verifies through blockchain-based lifelong biometric records.

Reasoning from forecaster3 for URL dummy://test.com: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: 75 years (from 2025 to 2100).

(b) The outcome if nothing changed: 122 years — the current verified record set by Jeanne Calment in 1997 would still stand, as no biological, medical, or societal changes occur to extend maximum human lifespan.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: 123–126 years — modest gains from improved global health, nutrition, and geriatric care could allow a few individuals to slightly exceed the current record, but without radical breakthroughs, biological limits would constrain increases.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets: Most gerontologists and demographers believe human maximum lifespan is near a biological ceiling of 120–125 years. Markets or prediction platforms (e.g., Metaculus, Manifold) — where they exist — typically give low probability to anyone exceeding 130 by 2100, with median forecasts clustering around 123–127. Consensus is skeptical of radical life extension within this timeframe.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: Global collapse due to climate catastrophe, nuclear war, or engineered pandemics drastically reduces life expectancy and healthcare access; the oldest human in 2100 is only 105 due to systemic societal failure and loss of medical infrastructure.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: A biomedical “longevity escape velocity” is achieved — perhaps through CRISPR-based gene editing, senolytics, partial reprogramming, or AI-designed anti-aging therapeutics — enabling not just slower aging but reversal of biological age. The oldest human in 2100 is 150+ due to stacking therapies that reset biological clocks multiple times.

Reasoning from forecaster3 for URL dummy://test.com: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: 74 years, 3 months, and ~20 days (from 2025-09-10 to 2100-01-01, assuming measurement is taken as of the start of 2100).

(b) The outcome if nothing changed: 122.0 years (current verified record remains unchallenged; no medical, societal, or technological progress).

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: ~123–125 years (slow incremental gains from improved global health, nutrition, and minor medical advances; more centenarians increase probability of record-breaking outlier, but biological limits constrain major leaps).

(d) The expectations of experts and markets: Most gerontologists and demographers believe human lifespan is biologically capped near 120–125 years; few credible models predict consistent exceedance of 122 before 2100. No major prediction markets show strong consensus beyond 125. Expert surveys (e.g., from aging research institutions) typically show median estimates around 123–126, with long right tails for optimists.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: Global collapse due to climate tipping points, nuclear conflict, or engineered pandemics disproportionately kills elderly populations or disrupts healthcare systems for decades. Verification systems (e.g., Guinness) collapse or become unreliable, leading to no credible claimants above 110 despite isolated survival. Societal collapse reverts average lifespan downward, and no supercentenarian survives in degraded conditions.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: Breakthroughs in epigenetic reprogramming, senolytics, or AI-designed personalized longevity therapies emerge by 2040–2060 and are rapidly scaled. “Longevity escape velocity” is achieved — each year lived adds more than a year of biological youth. The first 150-year-old is credibly verified by 2095 after entering anti-aging therapy at age 80. Global cooperation ensures equitable access, and robust age-verification infrastructure validates the claim.

Reasoning from forecaster3 for URL dummy://test.com: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: 75 years (from 2025 to 2100).

(b) The outcome if nothing changed: 122.0 years (Jeanne Calment’s verified record remains unbroken; no medical or societal advancements occur).

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: 123–125 years (gradual improvements in healthcare, nutrition, and verification yield modest increases, consistent with gerontological skepticism about radical lifespan extension).

(d) The expectations of experts and markets: Most gerontologists and demographers believe the biological limit is near 120–125 years. Market forecasts (e.g., longevity biotech investments) are optimistic about healthspan extension but not maximum lifespan breakthroughs before 2100. Public prediction markets (e.g., Metaculus) show median forecasts around 124–126, with long tails.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: Global collapse due to climate catastrophe, nuclear war, or engineered pandemic disproportionately kills elderly populations or destroys medical infrastructure, halting progress and reducing record longevity to near 110–115 due to systemic failure in verification and survival conditions.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: Breakthroughs in cellular reprogramming, senolytics, or AI-designed gene therapies unlock “escape velocity” in aging by 2050, enabling some individuals to reach 140–160 years through iterative biological resets; combined with perfect record-keeping and global peace, this allows verified supercentenarians to emerge.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed: 122.0 years (Jeanne Calment’s record stands unbroken; no medical or societal shifts occur to extend maximum human lifespan).

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: 125.0–127.0 years (gradual increase due to more centenarians, better global healthcare, and incremental medical advances, but still facing biological plateaus).

(d) The expectations of experts and markets: Most gerontologists and demographers believe the biological limit is near 120–125 years. Markets currently show no significant betting or investment implying belief in radical life extension by 2100 (e.g., no major longevity futures market pricing in supercentenarians beyond 130). Expert consensus surveys (e.g., from Pew, WHO-affiliated panels, or aging research institutes) suggest median expectations of 123–128, with long tails.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: A global catastrophe (e.g., nuclear conflict, engineered pandemic, or climate collapse) disproportionately affects the elderly or disrupts medical infrastructure, leading to poorer health outcomes for the oldest cohorts. Alternatively, societal collapse or economic regression reduces access to advanced care for the very old, causing the maximum verified age to drop or stagnate (though not below 100).

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: A biomedical breakthrough — such as CRISPR-based epigenetic reprogramming, senolytic therapies achieving widespread clinical use, or AI-designed personalized longevity regimens — becomes safe and scalable by 2050. Combined with global wealth and AI-assisted healthcare systems, this allows a small cohort of currently middle-aged individuals to delay aging dramatically, pushing the maximum verified age to 140–160 by 2100. Verification systems adapt rapidly to confirm authenticity.

Reasoning from forecaster3 for URL dummy://test.com: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: 75 years (from 2025 to 2100).

(b) The outcome if nothing changed: 122 years — the current verified record set by Jeanne Calment in 1997 would remain unbroken, assuming no medical, scientific, or societal advances occur.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: 125–130 years — gradual improvements in global healthcare, nutrition, and geriatric medicine may allow a small number of individuals to exceed the current record slightly, but not dramatically, based on the slow pace of verified record-breaking over the last 25+ years.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets: Gerontologists and demographers are largely skeptical of dramatic lifespan increases; most believe biological limits cap human lifespan near 120–125 years. No major prediction market exists specifically for this question, but academic consensus trends toward modest, not revolutionary, gains. Some longevity startups and futurists predict radical life extension, but these views are considered speculative and lack mainstream scientific validation.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: A global catastrophe — such as a prolonged climate collapse, nuclear conflict, or engineered pandemic — disproportionately kills or accelerates aging in the elderly, or destroys record-keeping infrastructure, preventing accurate age verification. Even if some individuals live longer, their ages cannot be officially recognized, resulting in no new verified record above 122.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: A biomedical breakthrough — such as programmable epigenetic reprogramming, senolytic therapies that safely clear aged cells at scale, or AI-accelerated drug discovery targeting multiple aging pathways — achieves clinical deployment by 2050–2070, enabling supercentenarians to maintain organ function and avoid age-related disease. Rigorous verification systems (e.g., blockchain birth records, lifelong biometric monitoring) confirm ages of individuals reaching 140+ by 2100.

After synthesizing the base rate (current record + slow historical progress), inside-view considerations (biotech trends, demographic scaling), expert skepticism, and tail risks (both negative and positive), I construct a wide 90% confidence interval to account for deep uncertainty and unknown unknowns over a 75-year horizon.

I anchor to the base rate: no verified person has exceeded 122 in over 25 years. Even with billions more centenarians by 2100, biological constraints may persist. But I assign non-negligible probability to breakthroughs, especially given compounding innovation in AI, genomics, and regenerative medicine.

I avoid scope insensitivity by considering that “oldest human” requires not just survival but verification — which may improve, increasing the chance of detecting true outliers.

I use Fermi-style reasoning: if 10 million people are 100+ by 2100 (up from ~600,000 today), and if the extreme tail of the survival curve shifts slightly due to interventions, someone statistically might reach 130–140 — but only if aging is modifiable beyond current limits.

I weight expert consensus heavily but leave room for black swans. I don’t overweight futurist hype, but I also don’t dismiss converging technologies.

Final calibration: wide intervals, with 10th percentile just above the hard floor (100), 50th percentile slightly above current record, and 90th percentile accounting for transformative but plausible breakthroughs.

(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known:
The outcome will be known by 2100, which is approximately 75 years from today (2025-09-10).

(b) The outcome if nothing changed:
If nothing changed from current conditions, the oldest verified human age record would remain at 122 years.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued:
If the current trend in aging and health improvements continues gradually, we might see more people living to around 110-120 years, but the probability of exceeding the current record of 122 years remains uncertain. Based on existing trends and biological constraints, the age of the oldest human might hover around 120-125 years by 2100.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets:
Gerontologists and demographers generally expect that the maximum human lifespan is around 120-125 years. While some are optimistic about future advancements, the consensus is cautious about exceeding this limit significantly. Markets might reflect this cautious optimism with slight improvements but not dramatic increases.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome:
A global catastrophe, such as a severe pandemic or widespread environmental degradation, could lead to reduced healthcare access and quality, resulting in lower overall life expectancies. In such a scenario, the oldest age might not exceed 105-110 years.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome:
A breakthrough in anti-aging technology, such as effective genetic therapies, regenerative medicine, or novel health science discoveries, could drastically extend human lifespan. In this scenario, the oldest age might reach 150-200 years, depending on the effectiveness and widespread adoption of these advancements.

Given the uncertainties and potential for unexpected breakthroughs or setbacks, a wide confidence interval is appropriate. Here is the final forecast distribution:

(b) The outcome if nothing changed: If medical advancements stall, biological aging limits hold, and verification protocols remain strict, the oldest human age by 2100 would likely stay near the current Guinness record of 122 years, with no meaningful increase.  

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: The trend in maximum lifespan (the oldest verified age) has been flat for over two decades (since Jeanne Calment’s 122-year record in 1997). Continuing this, the oldest human by 2100 would likely range from 122 to 124 years, as population aging increases centenarian numbers but not maximum lifespan.  

(d) The expectations of experts and markets: Most gerontologists and demographers peg maximum human lifespan at 120–125 years, citing biological constraints (e.g., cellular aging, DNA damage). Experts widely expect the oldest human by 2100 to fall within this range, with <10% probability of exceeding 125 years. No formal markets exist, but scientific consensus aligns with this skepticism.  

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: A global catastrophic event—such as a lethal pandemic targeting the elderly, a climate disaster (e.g., widespread famine/drought), or a nuclear conflict—could decimate centenarian populations. In this case, the oldest human by 2100 might plummet to 105–110 years (just above the 100-year floor), as few elderly survivors would remain.  

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: A transformative anti-aging breakthrough—e.g., widespread adoption of senescence-clearing drugs, organ regeneration via 3D bioprinting, or CRISPR editing of aging-related genes—could dramatically extend healthy lifespan. If such tech matures by 2100, the oldest human might reach 150–200 years, as individuals could avoid age-related diseases indefinitely.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed: 122 years. The current Guinness World Record for the oldest human (122 years) would remain unbroken, as no new medical advancements or biological breakthroughs occur to extend maximum lifespan beyond existing limits.  

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: 122–125 years. The trend of stable maximum lifespan (plateaued at ~122 for two decades) and gradual increases in centenarian numbers, but not record-breaking ages, would persist. Most gerontologists estimate the biological ceiling for human lifespan is 120–125 years, so the oldest human would likely hover near the upper end of this range.  

(d) The expectations of experts and markets: Expert consensus (gerontologists, demographers) leans toward skepticism of exceeding 122 years, with most predicting maximum lifespan will stay between 120–125 years. There are no formal markets for this outcome, but academic research consistently cites biological constraints (e.g., cellular aging, DNA repair limits) as barriers to surpassing 122.  

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: A global "aging crisis" driven by extreme climate events (e.g., recurring heatwaves, crop failures) or a novel pathogen (e.g., a hyper-contagious virus targeting the elderly) in the 2050s–2070s. This could drastically reduce life expectancy for older adults, with the oldest human by 2100 plateauing at 105–110 years (just above the 100-year floor).  

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: A revolutionary anti-aging therapy developed in the 2030s–2040s, such as safe senescence reversal (clearing aging cells) or gene editing to repair telomere degradation. If widely accessible to a small cohort (e.g., born 2020–2040), individuals could live to 150–170 years by 2100, pushing the maximum age to 160–170 years.

Formal markets for this outcome are limited, but expert surveys consistently lean toward no exceedance of 122 years, with minor upward revision possible (123–125) if health trends continue without breakthroughs.  

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: A global health crisis (e.g., a novel pandemic or antibiotic-resistant disease) disproportionately targeting older adults, coupled with collapsed healthcare systems in aging populations, could reduce the maximum age to 110–115 years by 2100.  

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: A breakthrough in anti-aging science (e.g., safe telomere lengthening, systemic senolytic therapies, or regenerative medicine that reverses age-related decline) could extend maximum lifespan by 20–30 years, leading to an oldest age of 140–150 years.

Reasoning from forecaster7 for URL dummy://test.com:  (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known:
As of September 10, 2025, there are 74 years and 3 months until January 1, 2100, when we would know the age of the oldest human living at that time.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed:
If no significant changes occurred in medicine, lifestyle, or other factors affecting human longevity, the age of the oldest human would likely remain close to the current record of 122 years, considering the biological limits that have been observed historically.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued:
The current trend in developed countries suggests incremental improvements in healthcare and living conditions, which could lead to a modest increase in lifespan. This could potentially lead to a new record, but likely not exceeding 125 years due to the biological constraints that have been observed thus far.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets:
Experts are generally cautious about predicting substantial increases in the maximum human lifespan. Most demographers and gerontologists believe that the maximum lifespan is around 120-125 years. However, there are optimistic views that anticipate breakthroughs in medicine and technology could extend this limit, potentially reaching ages beyond 130 years.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome:
An unexpected global event, such as a catastrophic pandemic more severe than COVID-19, could disproportionately affect the elderly, leading to a decrease in life expectancy and preventing anyone from reaching the current maximum age. Additionally, negative societal changes, such as widespread economic collapse or environmental degradation, could also limit access to quality healthcare and nutrition, thereby reducing human lifespan.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome:
A breakthrough in anti-aging research, such as the development of effective senolytics, gene therapies, or regenerative medicine, could drastically extend the human lifespan. If such treatments became widely available and were able to slow down or even reverse the aging process, it's conceivable that individuals could live well beyond 122 years, potentially reaching ages of 150 years or more.

Given these considerations, my forecast for the age of the oldest human as of 2100 is as follows:

"
Percentile 10: 110
Percentile 20: 115
Percentile 40: 120
Percentile 60: 125
Percentile 80: 130
Percentile 90: 140
"

This distribution reflects the uncertainty around future developments in medical science and the potential for unforeseen global events. The lower percentiles account for the possibility of stagnation or regression in lifespan due to unforeseen challenges. The higher percentiles reflect the potential for significant medical breakthroughs that could extend human lifespan beyond current expectations.

Reasoning from forecaster7 for URL dummy://test.com:  (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known:
Given that today is 2025-09-10, there are approximately 75 years until the year 2100, which is the timeframe in question for the age of the oldest human.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed:
If we assume that no significant advancements are made in life extension and the current biological limits of human lifespan remain, the outcome would likely stay at or near the current record of 122 years.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued:
The current trend suggests that while more people may reach centenarian status, significant breakthroughs in extending the maximum human lifespan beyond 122 years are uncertain. As such, the continuation of the current trend might not lead to a substantial increase beyond the current record.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets:
Experts are divided, but many gerontologists and demographers lean towards skepticism that the maximum human lifespan will significantly exceed 122 years, suggesting a limit around 120-125 years. The markets, including biotech and pharmaceutical companies, are investing heavily in anti-aging research, but the fruition of these investments is uncertain.

(e) An unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome:
An unexpected global crisis, such as a severe pandemic more deadly than any previously encountered, could disproportionately affect the elderly population, potentially leading to a decrease in average life expectancy and reducing the chances of surpassing the current longevity record.

(f) An unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome:
A breakthrough in regenerative medicine, such as the development of effective anti-aging treatments that can reverse cellular senescence, could dramatically extend the healthy human lifespan, potentially allowing individuals to live beyond 122 years, possibly even approaching 150 years or more.

Given these considerations and the need for humility and wide confidence intervals in forecasting, the final answer, accounting for the range of possibilities from unexpected low to high outcomes, is as follows:

"
Percentile 10: 100 (reflecting a scenario where global crises severely impact longevity)
Percentile 20: 110 (accounting for modest improvements in longevity)
Percentile 40: 120 (reflecting the current expert consensus on the biological limits of human lifespan)
Percentile 60: 125 (factoring in a slight increase due to potential medical advancements)
Percentile 80: 135 (acknowledging significant but not revolutionary advancements in life extension)
Percentile 90: 150 (representing a high outcome where breakthroughs drastically alter lifespan expectations)
"

This forecast reflects a wide range of potential outcomes, anchored in the current record and expert consensus, while allowing for the possibility of significant advancements in longevity research. It also incorporates the potential for global events to negatively impact life expectancy.

Reasoning from forecaster6 for URL dummy://test.com: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: 75 years (from 2025 to 2100).  

(b) The outcome if nothing changed: 122 years. If no new medical advancements, unchanged biological limits, or unexpected global events occur, the oldest human age would remain capped at the current Guinness record of 122 years.  

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: 124 years. The current trend shows maximum lifespan plateauing around 120–125 years due to biological constraints, with most gerontologists predicting the upper bound of human lifespan will not exceed 125 years without breakthroughs.  

(d) The expectations of experts and markets: Experts are split, but the consensus leans toward 120–125 years as the biological limit. Markets (limited in this area) would likely reflect a high probability of 122–125 years and a small tail risk of higher ages, with an expected value around 123 years.  

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: A global pandemic or climate disaster (e.g., extreme heatwaves, resource scarcity) that disproportionately kills elderly populations, reducing the survival rate of people over 100. This could drop the oldest human age to 105–110 years by 2100.  

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: A revolutionary anti-aging breakthrough (e.g., telomere repair, senescence-clearing therapies, or genetic editing to eliminate age-related diseases) that extends healthy lifespan by 30–50%. This could allow some individuals to live to 150–170 years, making the oldest human age 160–180 years by 2100.

Reasoning from forecaster6 for URL dummy://test.com: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: Approximately 75 years (from 2025 to 2100).  

(b) The outcome if nothing changed: 122 years. This assumes no advancements in medicine or lifestyle that extend maximum lifespan, keeping the record stagnant at Jeanne Calment’s verified age.  

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: 123–124 years. The current trend shows a flat maximum age (no new records since 1997) but increasing numbers of centenarians due to better healthcare. A slow upward drift in maximum age, limited by biological constraints, could push the oldest human to 123–124 by 2100.  

(d) The expectations of experts and markets: Most gerontologists and demographers anticipate the maximum human lifespan will remain within 120–125 years due to biological limits (e.g., telomere shortening, cellular aging). Markets (where limited) typically favor outcomes near the current record (122) with low odds of exceeding 125, as breakthroughs remain experimental.  

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: A global catastrophic event—such as a highly lethal pandemic targeting the elderly, a major climate disaster (e.g., extreme heatwaves/famines) disrupting healthcare, or widespread conflict—could drastically reduce survival rates for older adults. In this case, the oldest human in 2100 might only reach ~110–115 years, as fewer people would live to extreme ages.  

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: A revolutionary medical breakthrough, such as safe and scalable telomere regeneration, CRISPR-based elimination of aging-related genes, or widespread use of regenerative medicine to replace degenerative organs, could extend healthy lifespan by decades. If such a breakthrough is developed and accessible by 2050, the oldest human might reach 150–170 years, shattering current records.

Reasoning from forecaster7 for URL dummy://test.com:  (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known:
We have 75 years until the year 2100, which is the deadline for the outcome of this question.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed:
If no significant changes occur in our understanding of aging and no breakthrough technologies are developed, the oldest human in 2100 would likely be around the current record of 122 years.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued:
Given the current trends in medical technology, healthcare, and increased knowledge of genetics and biology, it is possible that the average human lifespan will continue to increase. However, the maximum lifespan may not increase significantly beyond the current record. Experts suggest that even with improvements, the biological limits of human lifespan could cap the maximum age at around 120-125 years.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets:
Experts are divided, with some suggesting that biotechnological breakthroughs could significantly extend the human lifespan, while others believe that we are approaching the natural limits of human longevity. The markets may reflect optimism about the potential for life-extending technologies, but the consensus among gerontologists leans towards skepticism about surpassing the 122-year mark.

(e) An unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome:
An unexpected global crisis, such as a widespread and virulent pandemic that disproportionately affects the elderly, could drastically reduce life expectancy and prevent anyone from reaching the current maximum lifespan by 2100. Additionally, if research into aging and longevity were to stagnate or be deprioritized due to shifts in funding or societal values, we might not see significant increases in the maximum human lifespan.

(f) An unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome:
A breakthrough in anti-aging medicine, such as the development of effective regenerative therapies or successful interventions at the molecular level that target the aging process directly, could lead to a significant extension of the human lifespan. If such treatments became widely available and were capable of reversing or slowing down aging, it could lead to a situation where the oldest human in 2100 might be significantly older than the current record holder.

Given these considerations, my forecast for the age of the oldest human by 2100 is as follows:

Reasoning from forecaster7 for URL dummy://test.com:  (a) **Time Left Until the Outcome to the Question is Known:**
As of September 10, 2025, there are approximately 75 years left until the year 2100, which is when we would know the age of the oldest human. This time frame allows for significant scientific, medical, and demographic changes.

(b) **The Outcome if Nothing Changed:**
If no significant changes occurred in medicine, lifestyle, and understanding of aging, the outcome would likely be close to the current record. Thus, we might expect the oldest human to be around 122 years old by 2100, given that this is the current verified record held by Jeanne Calment.

(c) **The Outcome if the Current Trend Continued:**
The current trend in life expectancy improvements and the increasing number of centenarians suggests that more people will reach older ages. However, the trend does not necessarily imply that individuals will surpass the current maximum lifespan of 122 years. If the trend continues, we might see a modest increase from the current record.

(d) **The Expectations of Experts and Markets:**
Experts are divided, but many gerontologists and demographers lean toward the idea that the maximum human lifespan is around 120-125 years due to biological constraints. Market expectations may be more optimistic, especially with the ongoing investment in biotech and anti-aging startups. However, the consensus among scientists suggests that significant extension beyond the current record would be unlikely without transformative breakthroughs.

(e) **An Unexpected Scenario That Results in a Low Outcome:**
An unexpected global crisis, such as a catastrophic pandemic more severe than COVID-19, could disproportionately affect the elderly due to their weaker immune systems. This could lead to a significant decrease in life expectancy and reduce the chances of people reaching extreme old age, potentially keeping the oldest human age below the current record.

(f) **An Unexpected Scenario That Results in a High Outcome:**
A breakthrough in anti-aging or regenerative medicine, such as the discovery of a way to halt or reverse the aging process at the cellular level, could drastically extend the human lifespan. If such technologies were developed and made widely available, it could lead to a substantial increase in the maximum age humans can live to, potentially well beyond 122 years.

**Final Answer:**
Given the uncertainties and the potential for both unexpected negative events and transformative medical breakthroughs, a humble and wide confidence interval is warranted.

Synthesized reasoning for URL dummy://test.com: To synthesize a final balanced distribution from the given forecasts, we need to consider the commonalities and differences among the forecasters, as well as apply heuristics to resolve disagreements.

1. **Base Rates and Current Records**: All forecasters agree that the current record is 122 years, and without significant changes, it is unlikely to be surpassed. This sets a strong base rate.

2. **Trends and Expert Expectations**: Most forecasters suggest a ceiling around 120-125 years, based on current trends and expert consensus. This range is consistently reflected in the 40th to 60th percentiles across the forecasts.

3. **Potential for Breakthroughs**: While there is some optimism about breakthroughs in biotechnology and medicine, the likelihood of these leading to significantly higher ages (e.g., 150+) is generally considered low, though not impossible. This is reflected in the higher percentiles (80th and 90th).

4. **Unexpected Low Outcomes**: Scenarios involving global crises that could lower the maximum age to around 105-115 are considered by several forecasters, reflected in the lower percentiles.

5. **Wide Intervals and Uncertainty**: Given the long time horizon and potential for unforeseen developments, a wide distribution is appropriate. This accounts for both the potential for breakthroughs and catastrophic events.

Reasoning from forecaster7 for URL dummy://test.com:  (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known:
Given that today is September 10, 2025, there are approximately 74 years and 3 months until the year 2100.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed:
If we assume that no significant advancements are made in life extension and that the biological limits of human lifespan remain constant, the oldest human age would likely remain at the current record of 122 years.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued:
If the current trend of gradual improvements in healthcare, nutrition, and living conditions continues, we might see more individuals reaching the age of 100 and beyond. However, this does not necessarily imply an extension of the maximum lifespan. The trend suggests that the maximum age could remain around the current record of 122 years, with a possible slight increase.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets:
Experts are generally conservative about the prospects of significantly extending the maximum human lifespan. Most gerontologists believe the limit to human lifespan is around 120-125 years. The consensus among demographers and health scientists is that while average lifespans will likely increase, breaking the 122-year record is uncertain. The markets reflect this uncertainty, with no significant investments banking on the extension of the maximum lifespan beyond the current record.

(e) An unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome:
An unexpected scenario that could result in a low outcome might involve a global crisis that significantly impacts healthcare systems worldwide, such as a severe pandemic with a high mortality rate, especially among the elderly. This could reverse the progress made in life expectancy and reduce the chances of anyone reaching the current maximum age.

(f) An unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome:
A high outcome could result from a breakthrough in anti-aging technology, such as successful human trials of senolytic therapies that effectively clear out senescent cells, or the development of safe and effective CRISPR gene editing techniques aimed at combating the aging process. These advancements could potentially extend the maximum human lifespan significantly beyond the current record.

Given these considerations and the need for humility in forecasting, here are my estimates with wide confidence intervals to account for unknown unknowns:

Percentile 10: 100 (Very low: reflecting the potential for global crises that drastically reduce lifespan)
Percentile 20: 105 (Low: accounting for incremental improvements in healthcare with no breakthroughs)
Percentile 40: 110 (Reflecting a moderate increase due to steady advancements in medicine and lifestyle)
Percentile 60: 115 (A modest increase with some success in anti-aging research)
Percentile 80: 120 (High: some breakthroughs in life extension, but still within the conservative estimates of biological limits)
Percentile 90: 125 (Very high: significant advancements in life extension technologies, though still within the realm of possibility as suggested by some optimistic experts)

These estimates reflect the current state of knowledge and consensus views, while also acknowledging the potential for both unexpected negative events and transformative scientific breakthroughs.

Synthesized reasoning for URL dummy://test.com: To synthesize a final balanced distribution, let's analyze the agreements and disagreements among the forecasters:

1. **Base Rate (Current Record of 122 years):** Most forecasters agree that if nothing changes, the current record of 122 years will remain. This serves as a common baseline across predictions.

2. **Biological Ceiling (120-125 years):** There is a consensus among forecasters that the biological ceiling is around 120-125 years, with slight variations in how much this might be exceeded due to current trends.

3. **Potential for Breakthroughs:** While forecasters acknowledge the potential for breakthroughs, there is variability in how much weight is given to this possibility. Some forecasters allow for ages up to 150 or even 170 years, but these are generally considered low-probability, high-impact scenarios.

4. **Unexpected Low Scenarios:** Forecasters consider global crises (e.g., pandemics, climate change) that could reduce maximum ages, with estimates ranging from 100 to 115 years.

5. **Distribution Shape:** Most forecasters present a right-skewed distribution, reflecting the potential for breakthroughs while being anchored by the current record and biological limits.

Using these insights, we can synthesize a final distribution that respects the base rate and biological ceiling while allowing for the possibility of breakthroughs and unexpected low scenarios:

Percentile 10: 110  
Percentile 20: 118  
Percentile 40: 122  
Percentile 60: 128  
Percentile 80: 140  
Percentile 90: 150

Synthesized reasoning for URL dummy://test.com: To synthesize a final balanced distribution, let's analyze the agreements and disagreements among the forecasters and apply some heuristics:

1. **Base Rates and Current Record**: The current verified record is 122 years. Most forecasters agree that without significant breakthroughs, the age of the oldest human by 2100 will likely remain around this figure.

2. **Expert Expectations**: Most forecasters mention that experts and markets generally expect the human lifespan to be biologically capped around 120-125 years. This forms a consensus view that should weigh heavily in the final distribution.

3. **Incremental Gains**: Several forecasters suggest that incremental gains in healthcare and lifestyle could push the maximum age slightly higher, but not dramatically so. This suggests a modest increase in the median and upper percentiles.

4. **Breakthrough Scenarios**: While some forecasters allow for the possibility of significant breakthroughs that could extend the human lifespan dramatically, these are generally assigned low probabilities. This suggests that while the upper percentiles should account for these possibilities, they should not dominate the distribution.

5. **Low-Outcome Scenarios**: Most forecasters agree that global crises could lower the maximum age, but these scenarios are also generally considered less likely.

6. **Wide Intervals and Uncertainty**: Given the high level of uncertainty and the long time horizon, wide intervals are appropriate to capture the range of possibilities.

Based on these considerations, here's a synthesized final distribution:

Percentile 10: 110  
Percentile 20: 115  
Percentile 40: 122  
Percentile 60: 125  
Percentile 80: 135  
Percentile 90: 150
