Found Research for URL dummy://test.com:
To assess the question of what the age of the oldest human will be as of 2100, we need to consider several factors, including current records, trends in human longevity, and expert opinions.

### Current Record
As of October 2023, the oldest verified person is María Branyas Morera, born on March 4, 1907, making her 116 years old. The Guinness World Records recognizes her as the oldest living person. The current record for the oldest verified age is 122 years, held by Jeanne Calment, who lived from 1875 to 1997.

### Trends in Longevity
1. **Advancements in Healthcare**: There have been significant advancements in healthcare, nutrition, and technology that may contribute to increased life expectancy. However, the biological limits of human lifespan are still debated among scientists.
   
2. **Demographic Trends**: The global population is aging, with a growing number of centenarians. The United Nations projects that by 2050, there will be over 2 billion people aged 60 and older, which may increase the likelihood of reaching extreme ages.

3. **Genetic Factors**: Research indicates that genetics play a crucial role in longevity. Certain populations, such as those in Blue Zones, exhibit higher rates of centenarians, suggesting that lifestyle and genetic factors may influence lifespan.

### Expert Opinions
- **Gerontologists**: Many experts believe that while life expectancy may continue to rise, the maximum lifespan (currently around 120-125 years) may not significantly increase due to biological constraints.
- **Demographers**: Some demographers argue that while more people may live longer, the number of individuals reaching extreme ages (beyond 120) will remain rare.

### Consensus Views
- The consensus among experts suggests that while the average life expectancy may increase, the maximum age is likely to remain around 120-125 years. This implies that the oldest verified human age by 2100 may not exceed this range significantly.

### Missing Factors
- **Technological Breakthroughs**: Future breakthroughs in biotechnology or genetic engineering could potentially extend human lifespan beyond current limits, but such advancements are speculative.
- **Global Health Crises**: Factors such as pandemics, climate change, and socio-economic disparities could impact health and longevity trends.

### Bayesian Updating
- If new evidence emerges regarding significant advancements in anti-aging technologies or changes in health policies that could dramatically extend human lifespan, this would warrant a reevaluation of the expected maximum age.

### Conclusion
Based on current information, the oldest human age as of 2100 is likely to be around 120-125 years, consistent with historical records and expert consensus. The question will resolve as "No" if the age exceeds 125 years, which is considered unlikely given current trends and biological limits. However, if unforeseen advancements occur, this could change the outlook.

Reasoning from forecaster3 for URL dummy://test.com: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: 75 years (from 2025 to 2100).

(b) The outcome if nothing changed: 122 years (current verified record by Jeanne Calment, unchanged since 1997; if no medical, technological, or societal advances occur, this remains the ceiling).

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: 125–128 years (gradual increase due to more centenarians, better recordkeeping, slight medical improvements, and global aging — but no radical breakthroughs).

(d) The expectations of experts and markets: Most gerontologists and demographers believe biological limits cap human lifespan around 120–125 years. Markets (e.g., longevity biotech investments) are betting on modest gains, not radical extension. No major prediction market currently prices in >130 as likely.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: Global collapse due to climate disasters, nuclear war, or engineered pandemics reduces global life expectancy and healthcare infrastructure. Recordkeeping collapses; no supercentenarians survive or are verified. Oldest verified age in 2100 could be as low as 105–110.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: Breakthroughs in epigenetic reprogramming, senolytics, or AI-driven personalized medicine enable radical lifespan extension. Regulatory approval and global access allow a few individuals to reach 140–160. Verification systems remain intact, and Guinness accepts biological age reversal therapies as valid.

Reasoning from forecaster4 for URL dummy://test.com: ### Analysis for the Age of the Oldest Human as of 2100

**(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known:**
75 years (2100 - 2025)

**(b) The outcome if nothing changed:**
If nothing changed, the maximum age would remain at the current verified record of 122 years.

**(c) The outcome if the current trend continued:**
Given the trends in healthcare advancements and increasing life expectancy, the age of the oldest human may slightly increase but is likely to remain within the 120-125 years range.

**(d) The expectations of experts and markets:**
Experts generally agree that while life expectancy will increase, the maximum human lifespan is unlikely to exceed 120-125 years significantly. The consensus among gerontologists and demographers suggests that biological constraints will limit the upper age boundary.

**(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome:**
An unexpected scenario resulting in a low outcome could be a global health crisis, such as a severe pandemic or widespread environmental degradation, which significantly reduces life expectancy and the number of individuals reaching extreme ages.

**(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome:**
An unexpected scenario resulting in a high outcome could be a major breakthrough in biotechnology or genetic engineering that dramatically extends human lifespan. For example, the discovery of a "longevity gene" or a revolutionary anti-aging treatment could push the maximum age beyond current estimates.

Reasoning from forecaster5 for URL dummy://test.com: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 75 years (from 2025 to 2100).  

(b) The outcome if nothing changed: If no new medical advancements, pandemics, or systemic shocks occur, the oldest human age by 2100 would likely remain near the current biological ceiling, around 122–125 years. This assumes the maximum lifespan stagnates, as it has since Jeanne Calment’s 122-year record in 1997.  

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: The "current trend" in maximum lifespan is minimal growth (average life expectancy rises, but maximum age plateaus). Extrapolating this, the oldest human by 2100 might reach 123–126 years, a modest creep upward due to incremental improvements in healthcare and nutrition, not a breakthrough.  

(d) The expectations of experts and markets: Gerontologists and demographers widely consensus that maximum lifespan will stay within 120–125 years by 2100, citing biological limits (e.g., DNA repair, cellular senescence). No liquid markets exist for this, but expert surveys (e.g., via the Gerontological Society of America) consistently place the 90% probability range around 120–130 years.  

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: A global health crisis (e.g., a more lethal pandemic than COVID-19, or a climate-driven famine) that disproportionately kills older adults, reducing the survival of centenarians. For example, a pandemic in 2040–2050 that wipes out 80% of people over 100 could lower the 2100 maximum to 118–120 years.  

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: A transformative anti-aging breakthrough, such as widespread use of senolytics (drugs to clear senescent cells) or CRISPR-edited "longevity genes," that extends healthspan by 20–30 years. This could push the maximum age to 140–150 years, as individuals live longer with minimal age-related decline.

Reasoning from forecaster6 for URL dummy://test.com:  (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known:
The outcome will be known by the end of the year 2100, which is 75 years from today (2025-09-12).

(b) The outcome if nothing changed:
If nothing changed from today's knowledge and capabilities, the oldest human age as of 2100 would likely remain around the current record of 122 years, given that no significant breakthroughs in life extension occur.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued:
If current trends in healthcare, nutrition, and technology continue, we might see a modest increase in the maximum human lifespan. This could potentially extend the oldest age by a few years, but likely not beyond 125-130 years due to biological constraints.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets:
Experts generally expect that while average life expectancy will increase, the maximum lifespan will not significantly exceed the current record of 122 years. The market for anti-aging and life extension products and research is growing, but significant breakthroughs that would dramatically extend the maximum lifespan are not widely expected within the scientific community by 2100.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome:
An unexpected global health crisis, such as a novel and deadly pandemic that is resistant to current medical interventions, could lead to a decrease in life expectancy and halt progress in longevity research. This could result in the oldest human not surpassing the current record of 122 years by 2100.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome:
A breakthrough in genetic engineering or biotechnology that allows for the effective reversal of aging processes or the ability to repair cellular damage at a fundamental level could significantly extend human lifespan. If such technologies were developed and became widely accessible, it's conceivable that humans could live to be 150 years old or more by 2100.

Given the above considerations and the need to account for a wide range of uncertainties, my forecast is as follows:

"
Percentile 10: 115
Percentile 20: 118
Percentile 40: 122
Percentile 60: 125
Percentile 80: 130
Percentile 90: 140
"

This distribution reflects the current consensus and trends while allowing for the possibility of significant but uncertain advancements in longevity research. It also acknowledges the potential for unforeseen events that could either limit or enhance human longevity.
