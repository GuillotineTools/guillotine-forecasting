Found Research for URL dummy://test.com:
To assess the question of what the age of the oldest human will be as of 2100, we need to consider several factors, including current records, trends in longevity, and expert opinions.

### Current Record
As of October 2023, the oldest verified person is María Branyas Morera, born on March 4, 1907, making her 116 years old. The Guinness World Records recognizes her as the oldest living person. The current record for the oldest verified age is 122 years, held by Jeanne Calment, who lived from 1875 to 1997.

### Trends in Longevity
1. **Advancements in Healthcare**: There have been significant advancements in healthcare, nutrition, and technology that may contribute to increased life expectancy. However, the extent to which these advancements will lead to more individuals reaching extreme ages (e.g., over 110) is still debated.
  
2. **Demographic Shifts**: The global population is aging, with a growing number of centenarians. The United Nations projects that by 2050, the number of people aged 100 and older will increase significantly, which could influence the potential for new records.

3. **Genetic Factors**: Research indicates that genetics play a crucial role in longevity. Certain populations, such as those in "Blue Zones," exhibit higher rates of centenarians, suggesting that lifestyle and genetic predisposition are critical factors.

### Expert Opinions
- **Gerontologists**: Experts in aging suggest that while life expectancy is increasing, the number of supercentenarians (people aged 110 and older) remains relatively small. They caution against assuming that the current trends will lead to a significant increase in the age of the oldest person.
  
- **Demographers**: Some demographers argue that while the average life expectancy is rising, the maximum lifespan may not increase significantly beyond the current record of 122 years. They point to biological limits and the challenges of extreme aging.

### Consensus Views
- The consensus among experts is that while it is possible for someone to live beyond 122 years, the likelihood of this happening remains uncertain. The current record of 122 years has stood for over two decades, and there is no clear indication that this will change dramatically by 2100.

### Missing Factors
- **Environmental Influences**: Climate change, pandemics, and other global crises could impact health and longevity in unpredictable ways.
- **Socioeconomic Factors**: Access to healthcare and lifestyle choices will vary significantly across different regions, potentially affecting longevity.

### Bayesian Updating
- If new evidence emerges, such as breakthroughs in anti-aging research or significant changes in public health policy, this could shift the probabilities regarding the age of the oldest human by 2100.

### Conclusion
Based on current information, the age of the oldest human as of 2100 is likely to remain around the current record of 122 years, with a possibility of exceeding this age but with significant uncertainty. Therefore, the resolution of the question hinges on whether a new record is established by 2100, which remains uncertain given the current trends and expert opinions. 

**Resolution Criteria**: The question will resolve as "Yes" if a verified individual surpasses the age of 122 years by 2100, and "No" if no one exceeds this age. Given the current data, it is too early to definitively predict the outcome.

Reasoning from forecaster5 for URL dummy://test.com: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: Approximately 75 years (from 2025 to 2100).  

(b) The outcome if nothing changed: The oldest human would likely remain around the current Guinness World Record of 122 years, as no new advancements or shifts in healthcare/longevity would push the maximum age higher.  

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: The maximum lifespan has historically increased very slowly (e.g., ~0.4 years per decade since 1900). Extrapolating this trend, the oldest human by 2100 might reach ~125 years, reflecting minor incremental gains in the upper tail of longevity.  

(d) The expectations of experts and markets: Most gerontologists and demographers caution against dramatic increases in maximum lifespan, predicting the oldest human will likely stay near 122 years, with a small probability of reaching 125–130 years if incremental medical advancements (e.g., better geriatric care) materialize. No liquid markets exist for this outcome, but expert consensus leans toward stagnation or minimal growth in the record.  

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: A global catastrophe—such as a highly lethal pandemic targeting the elderly, a climate-induced famine/water crisis, or widespread conflict—could disrupt healthcare systems and reduce survival rates for supercentenarians. In this case, the oldest human by 2100 might only reach ~110–115 years, as fewer people would survive to extreme old age.  

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: A breakthrough in anti-aging science—such as widespread use of senolytics (to clear aging cells), CRISPR-edited "longevity genes," or regenerative medicine to repair organ decay—could dramatically extend healthspan and maximum lifespan. For example, if such technologies are developed and accessible globally, the oldest human might reach 150–200 years, far exceeding the current record.

Reasoning from forecaster6 for URL dummy://test.com:  (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known:
The outcome will be known by the end of the year 2100, which is approximately 75 years from today (2025-09-12).

(b) The outcome if nothing changed:
If nothing changed, the age of the oldest human as of 2100 would likely remain at or near the current record of 122 years.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued:
If the current trend of gradual increases in average life expectancy and improvements in healthcare continue, we might see a modest increase in the maximum lifespan. However, the trend for the maximum lifespan has not shown a consistent upward trajectory, suggesting that even with improvements, the age of the oldest human may not significantly surpass the current record by 2100.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets:
Experts and demographic trends suggest that while life expectancy may continue to rise, the maximum human lifespan may not increase substantially beyond the current record. The market for anti-aging and longevity research is growing, but it is uncertain whether this will translate into significant lifespan extension by 2100.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome:
An unexpected global crisis, such as a catastrophic pandemic more severe than COVID-19, could reverse gains in life expectancy and reduce the potential for individuals to reach extreme old ages. Additionally, significant environmental degradation or societal collapse could limit access to healthcare and nutrition, leading to a lower outcome.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome:
A breakthrough in anti-aging medicine, such as the development of effective senolytics, gene therapies, or regenerative treatments that significantly slow down or reverse the aging process, could lead to a substantial increase in the maximum human lifespan. If such treatments became widely available and effective, it could result in a high outcome, with individuals living well beyond 122 years.

Given the wide range of uncertainties and the potential for both unexpected negative and positive scenarios, the forecast should reflect a broad distribution of possible outcomes. Here is the final answer with percentiles reflecting the wide confidence intervals:

"
Percentile 10: 110
Percentile 20: 115
Percentile 40: 120
Percentile 60: 125
Percentile 80: 130
Percentile 90: 135
"

This forecast suggests that there is a 10% chance that the oldest human in 2100 will be no older than 110 years, a 20% chance they will be no older than 115 years, and so on, up to a 90% chance they will be no older than 135 years. The distribution reflects the possibility of both stagnation in maximum lifespan and potential breakthroughs in longevity research.
