This question resolves positively if the first person to be born before January 1, 2000, who is verified to have lived to at least 120 years old (43,800 days) does so before January 1, 2050.

The resolution criteria are:
- The person must be born before January 1, 2000
- The person must live to at least 120 years old (43,800 days)
- This must be verified by reliable sources (e.g., Guinness World Records, gerontology research)
- The resolution date is January 1, 2050, regardless of when the person reaches 120

Current oldest verified person: Jeanne Calment (122 years, 164 days, died 1997)
Recent supercentenarians: Several people have reached 115-117, but none have reached 120 since Calment.
