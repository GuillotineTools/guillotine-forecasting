Found Research for URL dummy://test.com:
To assess the question of what the age of the oldest human will be as of 2100, we need to consider several factors, including current records, trends in human longevity, and expert opinions.

### Current Record
As of October 2023, the oldest verified person is Mar√≠a Branyas Morera, who was born on March 4, 1907, making her 116 years old. The Guinness World Records recognizes her as the oldest living person. The record for the oldest verified age is currently held by Jeanne Calment, who lived to be 122 years and 164 days, passing away in 1997.

### Trends in Longevity
1. **Advancements in Healthcare**: There have been significant advancements in healthcare, nutrition, and lifestyle that contribute to increased life expectancy. However, the rate of increase in maximum lifespan has not kept pace with average life expectancy improvements.
   
2. **Maximum Lifespan**: Research suggests that while average life expectancy may continue to rise, the maximum lifespan (the age of the oldest individuals) has remained relatively stable. The consensus among gerontologists is that the maximum human lifespan is likely capped around 120-125 years.

3. **Demographic Trends**: The population of centenarians (people aged 100 and older) is increasing, but the number of supercentenarians (people aged 110 and older) remains small. The growth in this demographic may not necessarily indicate a significant increase in the maximum age.

### Expert Opinions
- **Gerontologists**: Many experts believe that while we may see more people living into their 100s, the record for the oldest human will not exceed 122-125 years in the near future. 
- **Genetic Factors**: There is ongoing research into the genetic factors that contribute to longevity, but no definitive breakthroughs have been made that would suggest a significant increase in the maximum lifespan.

### Base Rates and Consensus Views
- Historically, the oldest verified age has not exceeded 122 years. The base rate for supercentenarians reaching ages beyond 120 is extremely low.
- The consensus view among experts is that while life expectancy may continue to rise, the age of the oldest verified human is unlikely to surpass the current record of 122 years by 2100.

### Missing Factors
- **Technological Advances**: Future breakthroughs in biotechnology, genetics, and anti-aging research could potentially alter the landscape of human longevity, but these remain speculative.
- **Environmental Factors**: Changes in global health, pandemics, and environmental factors could also impact longevity trends.

### Conclusion
Based on current information, the age of the oldest human as of 2100 is likely to be capped at around 122-125 years, consistent with historical records and expert opinions. Therefore, the resolution of the question, based on the criteria of the official Guinness record, would likely be **No**, as it is improbable that anyone will surpass the age of 122 years by that time.

Reasoning from forecaster1 for URL dummy://test.com: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is 75 years, as the year is currently 2025 and the question pertains to the year 2100.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed would be 122 years, as this is the current record for the oldest verified age, held by Jeanne Calment.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued would likely be around 122-125 years. While average life expectancy has increased, the maximum lifespan has remained relatively stable, with experts suggesting a cap around 120-125 years.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets generally align with the idea that the maximum human lifespan is unlikely to exceed 125 years by 2100. Advances in healthcare and genetics may improve average life expectancy, but the maximum age is expected to remain similar to current records.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: A global health crisis or environmental catastrophe significantly reduces life expectancy and impacts the longevity of the oldest individuals, resulting in a maximum age lower than current records.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: Breakthroughs in anti-aging research, biotechnology, or genetic engineering lead to significant extensions in human lifespan, allowing individuals to live well beyond the current record, potentially reaching 130 years or more.

Final answer:
```
Percentile 10: 122
Percentile 20: 123
Percentile 40: 124
Percentile 60: 125
Percentile 80: 127
Percentile 90: 130
```

Reasoning from forecaster1 for URL dummy://test.com: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: 75 years (from 2025 to 2100).

(b) The outcome if nothing changed: The current record of 122 years would remain the maximum age.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: Given the slow increase in maximum lifespan, the age might slightly increase to around 123-125 years.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets: Experts generally expect the maximum human lifespan to remain around 120-125 years, with no significant breakthroughs anticipated that would drastically increase this limit.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: A global health crisis or environmental catastrophe significantly reduces life expectancy and the number of supercentenarians, resulting in a maximum age closer to 120 years.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: Breakthroughs in biotechnology or genetic engineering lead to significant extensions in human lifespan, allowing individuals to live well beyond 125 years, potentially reaching 130 years or more.

Final answer:

Percentile 10: 120
Percentile 20: 122
Percentile 40: 123

(b) The outcome if nothing changed would be the current record of 122 years, as no new advancements or changes would alter the maximum verified age.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued would likely be around 122-125 years, as the maximum lifespan has remained relatively stable despite increases in average life expectancy.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets generally align with the view that the maximum human lifespan is unlikely to exceed 125 years by 2100, given current knowledge and trends.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome could involve a global catastrophe, such as a pandemic or environmental disaster, that significantly reduces human longevity and life expectancy.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome could involve a breakthrough in biotechnology or genetic engineering that dramatically extends human lifespan, allowing individuals to live well beyond the current maximum age.

Given these considerations, I will provide a range of percentiles to reflect the uncertainty and potential variability in the outcome:

Percentile 10: 122
Percentile 20: 123
Percentile 40: 124
Percentile 60: 125
