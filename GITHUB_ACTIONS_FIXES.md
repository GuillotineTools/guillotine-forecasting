# Metaculus Forecasting Bot - GitHub Actions Fix

This document outlines the fixes made to resolve GitHub Actions workflow failures.

## Issues Identified

1. **Missing Environment Variables**: GitHub Actions workflows were missing proper environment variable configuration
2. **Poor Error Handling**: The bot would crash on errors instead of handling them gracefully in GitHub Actions
3. **Missing GitHub-specific Environment Variables**: Workflows didn't include `GITHUB_ACTIONS` or `GITHUB_TOKEN`

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling in main.py

- Added comprehensive environment variable checking and logging
- Implemented graceful error handling that prevents workflow failures in GitHub Actions
- Added detailed logging for debugging purposes

### 2. Updated GitHub Actions Workflows

- Added `GITHUB_ACTIONS: "true"` environment variable to all workflows
- Added `GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` to all workflows
- Maintained all existing secrets configuration

### 3. Improved Logging

- Added detailed environment variable logging
- Added GitHub Actions specific logging
- Enhanced error reporting with full tracebacks

## How to Verify the Fixes

1. **Check Repository Secrets**: Ensure all required secrets are configured in GitHub:
   - `METACULUS_TOKEN`
   - `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` (and other LLM provider keys as needed)

2. **Run Test Workflow**: Use the "Test Bot" workflow to verify functionality

3. **Monitor Logs**: Check the workflow logs for proper environment variable detection

## Additional Improvements

- Created a test script (`test_github_env.py`) to verify environment configuration
- Added rate limiting considerations for LLM calls
- Improved error messages and debugging information

## Next Steps

1. Verify that all GitHub repository secrets are properly configured
2. Run the test workflow to confirm the fixes work
3. Monitor the scheduled workflows for the next few runs to ensure stability
