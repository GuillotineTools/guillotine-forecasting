Found Research for URL dummy://test.com:\nResearch on the changes in the oldest human age record indicates that while no specific articles were found, the topic is pertinent to forecasting the age of the oldest human by 2100. The current record stands at 122 years. Considerations for forecasting include potential advancements in medicine and healthcare that could extend human lifespan significantly by the end of the century.

Reasoning from forecaster1 for URL dummy://test.com: 1. **Rephrase and expand the question:**
   What will be the age of the oldest human alive as of the year 2100, according to the official Guinness World Records? Currently, the oldest verified age a human has reached is 122 years. Considering potential advancements in medicine and healthcare, how might this record change by 2100?

2. **Consider the base rate/extreme outcomes:**
   Historically, the record for the oldest human age has increased slowly. Jeanne Calment holds the record at 122 years, set in 1997. Prior to her, the record was held by Shigechiyo Izumi at 120 years, and before that by other supercentenarians who lived to 115-119 years. Extreme outcomes could be influenced by breakthroughs in medical technology, genetics, or anti-aging research.

3. **Estimate a reasonable range:**
   A reasonable range might be from the current record of 122 years to an optimistic upper bound of around 150 years. The lower bound assumes no significant breakthroughs, while the upper bound assumes substantial advancements in longevity science.

4. **Factors pushing toward the lower end:**
   - Lack of significant medical breakthroughs in anti-aging.
   - Potential societal or environmental factors that could negatively impact global health.
   - Continued challenges in translating scientific discoveries into effective treatments.

5. **Factors pushing toward the upper end:**
   - Major breakthroughs in genetic engineering or regenerative medicine.
   - Advances in personalized medicine and biotechnology.
   - Improved global healthcare access and preventative measures.

6. **Aggregate considerations:**
   Considering historical trends, potential for medical advancement, and societal factors, it's reasonable to expect some increase in the maximum age, but not necessarily an extreme one. The distribution should reflect a slight skew towards higher ages due to potential advancements.

7. **Initial probability distribution:**
   - Percentile 10: 123
   - Percentile 20: 125
   - Percentile 40: 130
   - Percentile 60: 135
   - Percentile 80: 140
   - Percentile 90: 145

8. **Evaluate confidence:**
   The distribution seems slightly optimistic but not excessively so, given the time frame and potential for advancements. It's important to remember that while breakthroughs are possible, they are not guaranteed. Adjusting slightly for this uncertainty might be wise.

9. **Final probability distribution:**
   - Percentile 10: *123*
   - Percentile 20: *126*
   - Percentile 40: *132*
   - Percentile 60: *137*
   - Percentile 80: *142*
   - Percentile 90: *147*

Reasoning from forecaster2 for URL dummy://test.com: ### 1. Rephrased and Expanded Question:  
"What will be the age of the oldest verified human alive or deceased as of 2100, as officially recognized by Guinness World Records, given current trends in longevity, potential breakthroughs in medicine, and historical precedents?"  

### 2. Base Rate/Historical Precedents:  
- The current verified record is Jeanne Calment at *122 years* (1997).  
- The second-oldest verified record is Sarah Knauss at *119 years* (1999).  
- Over the past 50 years, the record has increased by ~5 years (from 113 to 122).  
- Supercentenarians (110+) are rare but increasing in number due to better healthcare and documentation.  

### 3. Reasonable Range:  
- **Lower bound**: 122 years (current record is not broken).  
- **Upper bound**: 150 years (assuming radical breakthroughs in anti-aging, CRISPR, or AI-driven medicine).  
- More likely range: 125–140 years (moderate advancements in longevity science).  

### 4. Factors Pushing Toward Lower End (~122–130):  
- Stagnation in anti-aging research.  
- Regulatory hurdles slowing lifespan-extending therapies.  
- Environmental/pandemic setbacks (e.g., climate stress, new pathogens).  
- Societal collapse or resource scarcity reducing healthcare quality.  

### 5. Factors Pushing Toward Upper End (~130–150):  
- Rapamycin, senolytics, or gene therapies showing dramatic lifespan extension in trials.  
- AI-accelerated drug discovery (e.g., AlphaFold for aging targets).  
- Wealthy individuals investing heavily in longevity (e.g., Altos Labs, Calico).  
- Early-stage breakthroughs like partial cellular reprogramming or telomere extension.  

### 6. Superforecaster Aggregation:  
- **Median expectation**: ~130 years (modest progress, but no "moonshot" success).  
- **Right-tail risk**: Higher than left-tail due to accelerating biotech.  
- **Left-tail floor**: 122 years (record stands).  

### 7. Initial Probability Distribution (Percentiles):  
- 10%: ≤122  
- 20%: ≤125  
- 40%: ≤128  
- 60%: ≤132  
- 80%: ≤140  
- 90%: ≤150  

### 8. Calibration Check:  
- **Overconfidence?**: Initial range may underestimate tail risks (e.g., unforeseen collapse or singularity-like breakthroughs). Adjust upper bound to 160 for extreme outliers.  
- **Underconfidence?**: Lower bound seems reasonable (record unlikely to regress).  

### 9. Final Probability Distribution:  
- Percentile 10: *122*  
- Percentile 20: *125*  
- Percentile 40: *128*  
- Percentile 60: *132*  
- Percentile 80: *140*  
- Percentile 90: *150*  

### Rationale:  
- 50% confidence interval of *128–140* balances incremental progress with potential breakthroughs.  
- 10% chance the record isn’t broken (*122*) reflects skepticism about near-term progress.  
- 90th percentile (*150*) accounts for speculative but plausible "longevity escape velocity" scenarios.
