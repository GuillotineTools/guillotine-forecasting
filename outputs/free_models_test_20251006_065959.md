## Test Prompt

```

Question: Will artificial general intelligence (AGI) be achieved before 2030?

Provide a brief forecast with your probability assessment and reasoning.

Your response should include:
1. Your probability assessment (0-100%)
2. Brief reasoning (2-3 sentences)
3. Final answer format: "Probability: XX% - [Yes/No]"

```

## Model Response

```
**Probability: 20% - No**  
Reasoning: Achieving AGI by 2030 is unlikely due to the complexity of replicating human-like general intelligence, the lack of consensus on how to achieve it, and the current limitations in AI research and computational resources. While advancements in AI are rapid, they remain narrow and task-specific.
```

## Conclusion

✅ Free model configuration is working properly!
✅ GitHub Actions should work with this setup!
