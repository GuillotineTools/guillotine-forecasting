## Forecaster 1

Probability: 35% - Yes  

Reasoning: While current trends show an increase in supercentenarians, the maximum verified lifespan has not exceeded 122 years since Jeanne Calment. Advances in anti-aging research and medicine offer potential, but these technologies are not yet mature enough to reliably extend lifespans beyond the current record in the near term (by 2050). Given the small but non-zero chance of a breakthrough or outlier, a modest probability is justified.  

Final answer: Probability: 35% - Yes

## Forecaster 2

**Probability: 15% - No**

**Reasoning:** While advancements in medical and anti-aging technologies show promise, they are still in experimental stages and have not yet demonstrated the ability to significantly extend human lifespan beyond current records. The trend of supercentenarians reaching 110+ years has increased, but the maximum lifespan has not surpassed Jeanne Calment's 122 years. Given the current pace of progress and the lack of breakthroughs pushing the upper limit, it is unlikely that someone born before 2000 will live to 120 years by 2050.

## Forecaster 3

Probability: 30% - Yes  

Reasoning: While medical advancements and increasing supercentenarian numbers suggest progress in longevity, the current lack of breakthroughs significantly extending maximum lifespan beyond 122 years makes it unlikely. However, the possibility remains due to experimental anti-aging research and the small but growing pool of individuals approaching 120.  

Final Answer: **Probability: 30% - Yes**

## Forecaster 4

**Probability: 20% - No**

**Reasoning:** While advancements in anti-aging research and medical technologies offer potential, the current trends and records suggest that surpassing 120 years remains highly unlikely in the near term. The maximum verified lifespan has not increased significantly since Jeanne Calment's record, and even supercentenarians born before 2000 are still far from reaching 120. Given the experimental nature of many anti-aging technologies and the lack of breakthroughs to date, it is improbable that anyone born before 2000 will live to 120 by 2050.

## Forecaster 5

**Probability: 20% - No**

**Reasoning:** While advancements in medical and anti-aging technologies show promise, they are still in experimental stages and unlikely to significantly extend the maximum human lifespan by 2050. Current trends indicate that supercentenarians are increasing in number, but the upper limit of human lifespan has not surpassed Jeanne Calment's record of 122 years. Given the lack of breakthroughs and the rarity of individuals reaching 120+ years, it is improbable that anyone born before 2000 will achieve this milestone by 2050.

## Forecaster 6

Probability: 20% - Yes

Reasoning: While advancements in medical and anti-aging technologies show promise, they are still in experimental stages and unlikely to significantly extend lifespan by 2050. Additionally, current trends in supercentenarian lifespans have not surpassed Jeanne Calmentâ€™s record, suggesting that reaching 120 years remains highly exceptional. Given these factors, it is possible but improbable that someone born before 2000 will live to 120 by 2050.
