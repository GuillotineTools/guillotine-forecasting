To assess the question of whether interest in "ios 18.7" will be greater on September 27, 2025, than on September 18, 2025, according to Google Trends, we need to consider several factors that could influence search interest during this period.

### Current Context and Relevant Factors

1. **Release Schedule**: 
   - Apple typically releases new iOS versions in September. If "ios 18.7" is a minor update, it may not generate as much interest as a major release. However, if it includes significant features or fixes, interest could spike.

2. **Historical Trends**:
   - Looking at past trends for iOS updates, interest often peaks around the time of major announcements or releases. If "ios 18.7" is expected to be released or announced around this time, it could lead to increased search interest.

3. **User Engagement**:
   - The level of user engagement with previous iOS versions can provide insight. If users are generally satisfied with iOS 18, they may be more inclined to search for updates or features related to "ios 18.7".

4. **Media Coverage**:
   - The amount of media coverage leading up to September 27, 2025, will likely influence search interest. If tech news outlets are discussing "ios 18.7" extensively, this could drive more searches.

5. **Competitor Releases**:
   - If other tech companies release competing products or updates around the same time, this could divert attention away from "ios 18.7", potentially lowering search interest.

6. **Seasonal Factors**:
   - September is often a busy month for tech news due to back-to-school promotions and the lead-up to the holiday season. This could either increase or decrease interest depending on how "ios 18.7" is positioned in the market.

### Expert Opinions and Consensus Views

- **Tech Analysts**: Analysts often predict that minor updates like "ios 18.7" will not generate as much buzz as major updates. However, if there are significant features or security updates, they may still attract attention.
- **User Sentiment**: User forums and social media can provide insights into how excited users are about the upcoming update. Monitoring these platforms could give clues about potential interest levels.

### Missing Factors

- **Specific Features of "ios 18.7"**: Without knowing the specific features or improvements in "ios 18.7", it's difficult to gauge interest accurately. If the update includes highly anticipated features, interest could be significantly higher.
- **Market Conditions**: Economic factors or changes in consumer behavior leading up to September 2025 could also impact search interest.

### Conclusion

Based on the current information, the resolution of the question hinges on the specific context surrounding "ios 18.7" as the date approaches. If the update is significant and well-publicized, interest on September 27 could be higher than on September 18. Conversely, if it is a minor update with little media coverage, interest may not increase.

To finalize the assessment, monitoring Google Trends data closer to the dates in question will be crucial, as it will provide the definitive answer based on actual search interest.

To assess the question of whether interest in "ios 18.7" will be greater on September 27, 2025, than on September 18, 2025, according to Google Trends, we need to consider several factors that could influence search interest during this period.

### Current Context and Relevant Factors

1. **Release Schedule**: 
   - Apple typically releases new iOS versions in September. If "ios 18.7" is a minor update to a major release (like iOS 18), interest may peak around the time of its announcement or release. If the update is expected to be released shortly before September 27, this could drive higher interest on that date.

2. **Historical Trends**:
   - Looking at past trends for iOS updates, interest often spikes around major announcements or releases. If "ios 18.7" is positioned as a significant update, it could see increased interest as users seek information about new features or fixes.

3. **User Engagement**:
   - The level of user engagement with iOS updates can vary based on the perceived importance of the update. If "ios 18.7" includes notable features or improvements, it may generate more buzz and searches closer to its release date.

4. **Marketing and Media Coverage**:
   - Apple's marketing efforts and media coverage can significantly influence search interest. If there are promotional campaigns or media articles highlighting "ios 18.7" leading up to September 27, this could increase search volume.

5. **Competitor Releases**:
   - The competitive landscape can also affect interest. If other tech companies release significant products or updates around the same time, it may divert attention away from "ios 18.7".

6. **User Behavior**:
   - User behavior patterns, such as the tendency to search for updates after they are released or when issues arise, can also play a role. If users are experiencing problems with the current version, they may search for updates more frequently.

### Expert Opinions and Consensus Views

- **Tech Analysts**: Analysts often predict that interest in software updates will correlate with the timing of releases and the significance of the updates. If "ios 18.7" is expected to be a minor update, analysts might expect lower interest compared to major releases.
  
- **Base Rates**: Historically, interest in iOS updates tends to peak around release dates. If we consider the base rate of interest for previous iOS updates, we might expect a similar pattern for "ios 18.7".

### Missing Factors

- **Specific Features of "ios 18.7"**: Without detailed information on what "ios 18.7" entails, it is difficult to gauge its potential impact on search interest. If it includes critical security updates or new features, interest could be significantly higher.

- **External Events**: Any external events (e.g., major tech conferences, product launches from competitors) occurring around the same time could influence search behavior.

### Conclusion

Based on the factors outlined, the resolution of the question hinges on the timing of the release of "ios 18.7", the marketing efforts surrounding it, and the general user interest in iOS updates. If the update is significant and well-promoted, it is likely that interest will be greater on September 27 than on September 18. Conversely, if it is a minor update with little fanfare, interest may not increase.

In summary, while the current information suggests a potential for increased interest on September 27, the actual outcome will depend on the specific circumstances leading up to that date. The resolution will ultimately be determined by the data retrieved from Google Trends as specified.

To assess whether the community prediction for the Metaculus question "Will Spirit Airlines emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy before 2026?" will be higher than 6.00% on September 25, 2025, we need to consider several factors, including the current status of Spirit Airlines, expert opinions, and the broader context of airline bankruptcies.

### Current Status of Spirit Airlines
1. **Bankruptcy Filing**: Spirit Airlines filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in July 2023. The airline cited the need to restructure its debts and improve its financial position amid rising operational costs and decreased demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
2. **Restructuring Plans**: Spirit has outlined a restructuring plan that includes renegotiating contracts, reducing fleet size, and potentially securing new financing. The success of these plans will be critical in determining whether the airline can emerge from bankruptcy before 2026.

### Expert Opinions
1. **Industry Analysts**: Many analysts believe that the airline industry is slowly recovering, but the pace of recovery varies significantly among carriers. Some experts express cautious optimism about Spirit's ability to emerge from bankruptcy, especially if it can successfully implement its restructuring plan.
2. **Market Sentiment**: The sentiment around Spirit Airlines is mixed. While some analysts see potential for recovery, others are skeptical due to the competitive landscape and ongoing economic challenges.

### Base Rates and Historical Context
1. **Airline Bankruptcies**: Historically, airlines that file for Chapter 11 often take several years to emerge, with many facing significant hurdles. However, some airlines have successfully restructured and returned to profitability within a year or two.
2. **Recent Examples**: Other airlines that have recently emerged from bankruptcy, such as American Airlines and Delta, have shown that with the right restructuring and market conditions, recovery is possible.

### Consensus Views
1. **Current Community Prediction**: As of now, the community prediction for the Metaculus question is likely below 6.00%, given the uncertainty surrounding Spirit's restructuring efforts and the overall economic environment.
2. **Future Predictions**: The community's sentiment may shift as new information becomes available, particularly regarding Spirit's financial health, operational improvements, and market conditions leading up to September 2025.

### Missing Factors
1. **Economic Conditions**: The broader economic environment, including fuel prices, consumer demand, and potential recessions, could significantly impact Spirit's recovery and the community's sentiment.
2. **Regulatory Changes**: Any changes in regulations affecting the airline industry could also influence Spirit's ability to emerge from bankruptcy.

### Conclusion
Based on the current information, it appears that the community prediction is likely to be below 6.00% as of now, but this could change as Spirit Airlines progresses through its restructuring. The resolution of the question will depend on how the community perceives Spirit's chances of emerging from bankruptcy as the deadline approaches. Therefore, while the current sentiment may lean towards a "No," ongoing developments will be crucial for Bayesian updating as we approach the resolution date.

3. **Market Trends**: The overall market environment, including interest rates, inflation, and economic growth forecasts, can significantly impact stock prices.

### Expert Opinions
1. **Analyst Ratings**: Review recent analyst ratings and price targets for PNR. If there is a consensus among analysts that the stock is undervalued or has strong growth potential, this could indicate a higher closing price on September 26.

2. **Sector Performance**: The performance of the water treatment and sustainable solutions sector can also influence PNR's stock price. If the sector is expected to grow due to increased demand for sustainable solutions, this could positively impact PNR.

### Base Rates and Historical Data

2. **Volatility and Price Movements**: Understanding the stock's volatility and typical price movements can help gauge the likelihood of significant changes in price over the specified period.

### Current Context on German Federal Elections

1. **Scheduled Election Cycle**: German federal elections are typically held every four years. The last federal election took place on September 26, 2021. Based on this cycle, the next federal election is expected to occur in 2025, specifically in the fall, as elections are traditionally held in late September.

2. **Legal Framework**: The German Basic Law (Grundgesetz) stipulates that federal elections must be held at least every four years. There are provisions for early elections, but these are generally rare and would require significant political upheaval or a vote of no confidence.

3. **Political Landscape**: The current coalition government, led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz from the Social Democratic Party (SPD), is stable, although there are ongoing discussions about various policy issues. The coalition includes the Greens and the Free Democratic Party (FDP). As of now, there are no significant movements or events suggesting an early election.

4. **Expert Opinions**: Political analysts and experts generally agree that the next federal election will likely occur in 2025 unless extraordinary circumstances arise. The consensus is that the current coalition is expected to govern until the next scheduled election.

5. **Potential for Annulment**: If no federal election occurs before the end of 2029, the question will be annulled. While early elections are possible, they are not anticipated at this time. The stability of the current government and the absence of major political crises suggest that the likelihood of an annulment is low.

6. **Missing Factors**: While the current political climate appears stable, unforeseen events (e.g., economic crises, significant political scandals, or shifts in public opinion) could potentially lead to early elections. However, these factors are speculative at this point.

### Conclusion

Based on the current information, the next German federal elections are expected to occur in 2025. The question will resolve as "2025" unless extraordinary circumstances lead to an annulment, which currently seems unlikely. Therefore, the most relevant outcome based on current information is that the next federal elections will likely happen in 2025.

To assess the question of how many executive orders Donald Trump will sign during his second term as President, we need to consider several factors, including current political dynamics, historical context, and expert opinions.

### Current Context
1. **Trump's 2024 Campaign**: Donald Trump is currently running for president again in the 2024 election. His campaign has been characterized by a strong focus on his previous administration's policies and a commitment to implementing similar strategies if re-elected. This suggests he may prioritize signing executive orders to quickly enact his agenda upon taking office.

2. **Political Landscape**: The political environment leading up to the 2024 election is highly polarized. If Trump wins, he may face significant opposition from Congress, particularly if the Democrats retain control of the Senate or House. This could lead him to rely more heavily on executive orders to achieve his policy goals, as he did during his first term.

3. **Historical Precedent**: During his first term (2017-2021), Trump signed a total of 220 executive orders. This number is relatively high compared to previous presidents, indicating a willingness to use executive orders as a tool for governance. If he follows a similar pattern, we might expect a significant number of orders in his second term.

### Expert Opinions
- **Political Analysts**: Many analysts suggest that Trump is likely to continue using executive orders as a primary means of enacting policy, especially if he faces a divided Congress. This aligns with his previous approach and the current political climate.
- **Legal Experts**: Some legal scholars argue that the use of executive orders can be a double-edged sword, as they can be challenged in court. However, as per the resolution criteria, even orders that are blocked by courts will count toward the total.

### Base Rates and Consensus Views
- **Base Rates**: Looking at the average number of executive orders signed by recent presidents, Trump’s first term was notably prolific. If he maintains a similar pace, we could expect a substantial number of orders.
- **Consensus**: The general consensus among political commentators is that Trump will likely sign a significant number of executive orders if re-elected, particularly in the early months of his term.

### Missing Factors
- **Potential Early Exit**: If Trump were to leave office early for any reason (e.g., health issues, legal challenges), this would limit the total number of executive orders signed. However, as of now, there are no indications that this is likely.
- **Judicial Challenges**: The potential for judicial challenges to his executive orders could impact their implementation but not their count.

### Conclusion
Based on the current information, it is reasonable to anticipate that Trump will sign a notable number of executive orders during his second term, especially if he follows the pattern of his first term and faces a challenging legislative environment. The resolution of the question will depend on the actual number of executive orders published in the Federal Register during the specified term. 

**Current Resolution Status**: The question is open and will resolve based on the total number of executive orders signed and published during Trump's second term, starting January 20, 2025.

To assist with the question regarding Wells Fargo & Company (WFC) and its market close price on September 25, 2025, compared to September 18, 2025, here’s a detailed rundown of relevant factors and current information:

### Current Market Context
1. **WFC's Recent Performance**: As of the latest available data, WFC's stock has shown fluctuations influenced by broader market trends, interest rate changes, and economic indicators. Monitoring its performance leading up to the specified dates will be crucial.

2. **Economic Indicators**: Key economic indicators such as interest rates, inflation, and employment rates can significantly impact bank stocks like WFC. The Federal Reserve's monetary policy decisions will be particularly relevant, as they influence lending rates and bank profitability.

3. **Sector Performance**: The banking sector's overall health, including regulatory changes and competition, will also affect WFC's stock price. Recent trends in fintech and digital banking could pose both challenges and opportunities for traditional banks.

### Expert Opinions
- **Analysts' Ratings**: Financial analysts often provide ratings and price targets for stocks. Checking the consensus among analysts regarding WFC's future performance can provide insights into expected price movements.
- **Market Sentiment**: Investor sentiment, influenced by news cycles, earnings reports, and macroeconomic developments, can lead to volatility in stock prices. Monitoring sentiment indicators could provide clues about potential price changes.

### Base Rates and Historical Performance
- **Historical Price Trends**: Analyzing WFC's historical price movements around similar timeframes (e.g., end-of-quarter trends) can provide a baseline for expectations. Historically, bank stocks may experience seasonal trends based on quarterly earnings reports.

### Missing Factors
- **Unexpected Events**: Factors such as geopolitical events, natural disasters, or significant regulatory changes could impact WFC's stock price unexpectedly. Keeping an eye on news that could affect the financial sector is essential.
- **Technological Developments**: Innovations in banking technology or changes in consumer behavior could influence WFC's competitive position and, consequently, its stock price.

### Bayesian Updating
- As new information becomes available, particularly regarding economic indicators, earnings reports, and market sentiment, it will be important to update expectations about WFC's stock price. This could involve adjusting forecasts based on new data or trends.

### Conclusion
The resolution of the question hinges on the market close price of WFC on September 25, 2025, compared to September 18, 2025. Current information suggests that various economic and sector-specific factors will play a significant role in determining this outcome. Continuous monitoring of WFC's performance, analyst opinions, and broader market conditions will be essential in forming a well-rounded view leading up to the resolution date. 

In summary, while the current information does not provide a definitive answer, it highlights the importance of ongoing analysis and the potential influences on WFC's stock price as the dates approach.

### Current Market Context
1. **STX Overview**: STX, or Seagate Technology Holdings PLC, is a data storage company that has been facing challenges due to shifts in technology and market demand. Understanding its recent performance and market trends is crucial.

### Key Factors Influencing Price
1. **Market Trends**: The technology sector, particularly data storage, is subject to rapid changes.

4. **Company Developments**: Any upcoming product launches, partnerships, or strategic shifts by STX could significantly impact its stock price. Monitoring news releases and earnings reports will be essential leading up to the dates in question.

### Resolution Criteria
- The question will resolve to 'Yes' if STX's market close price on September 26, 2025, is higher than on September 18, 2025. 
- It is important to note that stock splits or reverse splits will be accounted for in the resolution, and any delisting events will resolve based on the final close price.

### Missing Factors

Recent earnings reports and guidance from the company can provide insight into its financial health and market sentiment.

### Key Influences on Future Price
1. **Regulatory Environment**: Changes in regulations affecting utility companies, especially in California, can significantly impact PCG's stock price. Any new legislation or regulatory decisions made before September 2025 could influence investor sentiment.

2. **Market Trends**: The overall stock market trends, particularly in the utility sector, will play a crucial role. If the market is bullish, it may lift PCG's stock price, while a bearish market could have the opposite effect.

3. **Economic Indicators**: Broader economic conditions, including interest rates, inflation, and consumer spending, will also affect investor confidence and stock prices. Monitoring these indicators leading up to September 2025 will be essential.

4. **Company Developments**: Any significant news regarding PCG, such as mergers, acquisitions, or changes in leadership, could impact its stock price. Additionally, developments related to its wildfire mitigation efforts and financial settlements will be critical.

### Expert Opinions and Consensus

To assist in forecasting whether BK's market close price on September 25, 2025, will be higher than its close price on September 17, 2025, here’s a detailed rundown of relevant factors and current information:

### Current Market Context
1. **Stock Performance**: As of now, BK (Bank of New York Mellon Corporation) has shown a mixed performance in the stock market. Recent trends indicate fluctuations influenced by broader economic conditions, interest rates, and banking sector performance.

2. **Economic Indicators**: Key economic indicators such as inflation rates, Federal Reserve interest rate policies, and overall market sentiment towards financial institutions will play a significant role in BK's stock price movement. If the economy is expected to improve, this could positively impact BK's stock price.

3. **Sector Performance**: The banking sector has been under scrutiny due to rising interest rates and regulatory changes. Analysts are divided on the future performance of banks, with some predicting a rebound as interest rates stabilize, while others caution about potential economic downturns.

### Expert Opinions
- **Analysts' Ratings**: Current analyst ratings for BK are mixed, with some analysts maintaining a "buy" rating based on expected growth in asset management and wealth management services, while others express caution due to potential economic headwinds.
- **Market Sentiment**: Investor sentiment appears cautious but optimistic, with many looking for signs of stability in the banking sector. 

### Base Rates and Historical Performance
- **Historical Price Trends**: Historically, BK's stock has shown resilience during economic recoveries but has also been susceptible to downturns. Analyzing past performance around similar dates (mid to late September) could provide insights into typical price movements.
- **Volatility**: The stock has experienced volatility, which could impact short-term price movements. Understanding the average volatility in the weeks leading up to the end of September could help gauge potential price changes.

### Missing Factors
- **Global Economic Events**: Potential geopolitical events, changes in fiscal policy, or unexpected economic data releases could significantly impact BK's stock price.
- **Company-Specific News**: Any announcements regarding mergers, acquisitions, or changes in leadership could also influence stock performance.

### Bayesian Updating
- As new information becomes available, particularly regarding economic indicators or company performance, it will be crucial to update expectations. For instance, if inflation rates decrease or if the Federal Reserve signals a pause in interest rate hikes, this could lead to a more favorable outlook for BK.

### Conclusion
Based on the current information, the outcome of whether BK's market close price on September 25, 2025, will be higher than on September 17, 2025, remains uncertain. The resolution will depend heavily on economic conditions, sector performance, and any significant company-specific developments leading up to those dates. Continuous monitoring of these factors will be essential for making an informed forecast.

To assess the question of whether interest in "ios 26 new features" will be greater on 2025-09-26 than on 2025-09-17 according to Google Trends, we can consider several relevant factors:

### Current Context and Anticipation
1. **iOS Release Cycle**: Apple typically announces new iOS features in September, often coinciding with their annual hardware event. If iOS 26 follows this pattern, interest is likely to peak around the time of the announcement and subsequent release.

2. **Historical Trends**: Looking at past iOS releases, interest tends to spike significantly around the announcement date and shortly thereafter. For example, interest in iOS 15 and iOS 16 saw substantial increases in the days leading up to and following their announcements.

3. **Public Engagement**: The tech community, including developers and consumers, often engages heavily with new features, especially if they are significant upgrades or introduce popular functionalities. This engagement can be tracked through social media, tech blogs, and forums, which often reflect spikes in interest.

### Expert Opinions and Consensus
- **Tech Analysts**: Experts in technology trends suggest that interest in new iOS features typically increases as the release date approaches. Analysts predict that if Apple maintains its usual schedule, interest will likely be higher on September 26 than on September 17.
  
- **Market Sentiment**: The sentiment around Apple's product launches tends to be positive, with anticipation building as the launch date nears. This is supported by historical data showing increased search interest leading up to major announcements.

### Missing Factors
- **External Events**: Any significant external events (e.g., competing product launches, major news stories) could impact interest levels. If another major tech event occurs around the same time, it could divert attention away from iOS 26.

- **User Sentiment**: If there are negative reviews or leaks about iOS 26 features prior to September 26, this could dampen interest. Conversely, positive leaks or rumors could enhance it.

### Bayesian Updating
- As new information becomes available (e.g., leaks about features, announcements from Apple), the forecast can be updated. If significant features are revealed or if there is a notable change in public sentiment, this could influence the interest levels.

### Conclusion
Based on the historical context, expert opinions, and the typical behavior of consumer interest around Apple product launches, it is reasonable to anticipate that interest in "ios 26 new features" will be greater on September 26 than on September 17. However, the final resolution will depend on the actual data retrieved from Google Trends on those specific dates. 

In summary, while the current information suggests a likely "Yes" resolution, the outcome will ultimately depend on the trends observed on the specified dates.

### Current Context on Pam Bondi as US Attorney General

**Background**: Pam Bondi was appointed as the United States Attorney General in 2021. She has a background in law and politics, having previously served as the Attorney General of Florida from 2011 to 2019. 

**Recent Developments**:
1. **Political Climate**: The political landscape in the U.S. is currently polarized, with significant scrutiny on the Department of Justice (DOJ) and its leadership. Bondi's position may be influenced by the ongoing investigations and political pressures surrounding the Biden administration.
   
2. **Public Statements**: As of now, there have been no public statements from Bondi indicating her intention to resign or step down from her role as Attorney General. She has maintained a relatively low profile compared to her predecessors, focusing on specific legal issues rather than engaging in broader political discourse.

3. **Speculation and Expert Opinions**: Political analysts suggest that Bondi's tenure could be influenced by the outcomes of upcoming elections, particularly the 2024 presidential election. If there is a change in administration, it is likely that the new president would appoint a new Attorney General. However, there is no consensus on whether Bondi would be replaced before March 2026, as it largely depends on the political dynamics at play.

4. **Base Rates**: Historically, U.S. Attorneys General serve for several years, but there have been instances of resignations or dismissals, particularly in politically charged environments. The average tenure of an AG is around 4-5 years, but this can vary significantly based on the administration's stability and public perception.

5. **Missing Factors**: Potential influences that could lead to Bondi's departure include:
   - Major legal controversies or scandals involving the DOJ.
   - Significant shifts in public opinion or political pressure.
   - Health issues or personal decisions that could lead to her stepping down.

### Conclusion on Resolution Criteria
Based on the current information:
- **Current Status**: Pam Bondi remains in her position as Attorney General with no announcements of her departure.
- **Likelihood of Departure**: While political dynamics could change, there is no immediate indication that she will leave her position before March 2026.
- **Resolution**: As of now, the question would resolve as **No**, since Bondi continues to legally hold the office of AG and has not announced any plans to leave before the specified date. 

### Recommendations for Monitoring
- Keep an eye on political developments, particularly related to the 2024 elections and any announcements from the Biden administration regarding the DOJ.
- Monitor public statements from Bondi and any significant legal challenges that may arise, as these could influence her tenure.

- **Recent Developments**: Lamichhane has been a prominent figure in Nepali politics, especially after the 2022 elections where his party gained significant traction. However, he faced legal challenges regarding his citizenship status, which temporarily affected his political standing.

#### Recent News and Developments
1. **Legal Challenges**: Lamichhane's eligibility to hold office has been questioned due to a Supreme Court ruling that disqualified him from his ministerial position in early 2023. This ruling was based on issues surrounding his citizenship, which he has since sought to rectify.
   
2. **Political Alliances**: The political landscape in Nepal is highly dynamic, with shifting alliances. Lamichhane's party has been part of various coalitions, and his ability to secure the Prime Ministership will depend on maintaining or forming new alliances.

3. **Public Support and Popularity**: Lamichhane has a strong base of support among younger voters and those disillusioned with traditional parties. However, his legal issues and the perception of his party's effectiveness could impact his popularity.

4. **Upcoming Elections**: The next general elections in Nepal are scheduled for 2025. Lamichhane's prospects for becoming Prime Minister will largely depend on the outcomes of these elections and his party's performance.

5. **Vote of Confidence**: Should Lamichhane become Prime Minister, he will need to secure a vote of confidence in the House of Representatives. This will require strategic maneuvering to ensure he has the necessary support from other parties.

#### Expert Opinions and Consensus Views
- **Political Analysts**: Many analysts believe that Lamichhane has a viable path to the Prime Ministership, especially if he can resolve his legal issues and capitalize on the political dissatisfaction among the electorate.
- **Public Sentiment**: There is a mixed sentiment regarding Lamichhane; while he has a dedicated following, concerns about his legal troubles and the stability of his party could hinder his chances.

#### Missing Factors
- **Legal Resolution**: The outcome of Lamichhane's legal challenges is critical. If he cannot resolve these issues satisfactorily, it could disqualify him from running for Prime Minister.
- **Coalition Dynamics**: The potential for new political alliances or shifts in the current coalition landscape could significantly impact Lamichhane's chances.
- **Economic and Social Issues**: Ongoing economic challenges and social unrest in Nepal could influence voter sentiment and the political landscape leading up to the elections.

### Conclusion
As of now, Rabi Lamichhane's path to becoming the next non-caretaker Prime Minister of Nepal is uncertain and contingent on several factors, including the resolution of his legal issues, the performance of his party in the upcoming elections, and the political alliances he can forge. The question of whether he will take the oath of office and win a vote of confidence remains open, with significant developments expected in the lead-up to the 2025 elections. 

**Resolution Status**: The question currently leans towards uncertainty, with no definitive Yes or No answer based on current information. Further developments, particularly regarding Lamichhane's legal status and political maneuvering, will be crucial in determining the outcome.

### Current Context on Kulman Ghising as Next Prime Minister of Nepal

#### Background
Kulman Ghising is a prominent figure in Nepal, known for his role as the Managing Director of the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA). His leadership has been marked by significant improvements in the country's electricity supply and infrastructure, which has garnered him public support. However, his political aspirations and potential candidacy for the Prime Ministership are subject to various factors.

#### Recent Developments
1. **Political Landscape**: The political environment in Nepal is dynamic, with multiple parties vying for power. The current Prime Minister, Pushpa Kamal Dahal (Prachanda), leads a coalition government. The stability of this coalition and the potential for shifts in alliances will significantly impact Ghising's chances.

2. **Public Support**: Ghising enjoys a favorable public image due to his achievements in the energy sector. However, public sentiment can be volatile, especially in the lead-up to elections. His ability to leverage this support into a political platform will be crucial.

3. **Party Dynamics**: Ghising is not currently affiliated with a major political party, which could hinder his chances unless he aligns with a significant political force. The ruling coalition's internal dynamics and any potential fractures could create opportunities for him.

4. **Electoral Timeline**: The next general elections in Nepal are expected to occur in late 2025, with the possibility of a caretaker government in place until then. Ghising's potential candidacy would need to be formalized well before the elections to gain traction.

5. **Vote of Confidence Requirement**: Should Ghising become Prime Minister, he would need to secure a vote of confidence in the House of Representatives. This requires not only winning the position but also ensuring he has the backing of a majority in the legislature, which is uncertain given the current coalition dynamics.

#### Expert Opinions
- **Political Analysts**: Many analysts suggest that while Ghising has the public appeal, his lack of a strong political base may limit his chances. They emphasize the importance of party affiliation and coalition-building in Nepal's political landscape.
- **Public Sentiment**: Surveys indicate that Ghising is viewed positively, but translating this into political capital will require strategic maneuvering.

#### Missing Factors
- **Coalition Changes**: Any significant shifts in the current ruling coalition or the emergence of new political alliances could dramatically alter the landscape.
- **Economic Conditions**: Economic stability and public service delivery in the lead-up to the elections will influence voter sentiment and Ghising's viability as a candidate.

### Conclusion
As of now, Kulman Ghising's path to becoming the next non-caretaker Prime Minister of Nepal is uncertain. While he has public support and a strong track record in his current role, the political dynamics, party affiliations, and the need for a vote of confidence present significant challenges. The question of whether he will take the oath of office and win a vote of confidence between September 11, 2025, and January 1, 2026, remains open, with current information suggesting a **No** resolution is more likely unless significant changes occur in the political landscape.

- **Potential Candidacy**: While Shah has not formally announced his candidacy for Prime Minister, his popularity and the current political climate suggest he could be a contender, especially if he leverages his mayoral success.

#### Expert Opinions
- **Political Analysts**: Some analysts believe that Shah's appeal to the youth and his independent status could position him favorably in the next elections. However, they caution that he may face challenges in gaining support from established political parties.
- **Coalition Politics**: Given the nature of Nepali politics, any potential candidacy would likely require forming alliances, which could complicate his path to the premiership.

#### Base Rates and Consensus Views
- **Historical Precedents**: Historically, mayors and local leaders have transitioned to national politics in Nepal, but success is contingent on broader political support and party dynamics.
- **Current Consensus**: The consensus among political commentators is that while Shah has potential, the unpredictability of coalition politics and the need for a strong party backing could hinder his chances.

#### Missing Factors

- **Public Support**: Ongoing public sentiment and any significant political events leading up to the elections could dramatically alter his prospects.

### Conclusion
As of now, Balendra Shah's path to becoming the next non-caretaker Prime Minister of Nepal remains uncertain. While he has the potential to be a significant candidate, various factors, including coalition politics and the need for broader support, will play a critical role in determining his viability. The question of whether he will take the oath of office and win a vote of confidence between September 11, 2025, and January 1, 2026, remains open, with current information suggesting a **No** resolution is more likely unless significant changes occur in the political landscape.

To assess whether Cracker Barrel's revenues will decline in Q1 FY2026 compared to Q1 FY2025, we need to consider several factors, including recent financial performance, industry trends, economic conditions, and expert opinions.

### Recent Financial Performance
1. **Q1 FY2025 Revenue**: Cracker Barrel reported total revenue of $845.089 million for Q1 FY2025.
2. **Q4 FY2025 Performance**: The most recent quarter's performance (Q4 FY2025) will provide insights into the company's trajectory. If Q4 FY2025 shows a decline or stagnation in revenue, it may indicate potential challenges in Q1 FY2026.

### Industry Trends
1. **Restaurant Industry Recovery**: The restaurant industry has been recovering post-pandemic, but there are signs of slowing growth due to inflation and changing consumer spending habits. If Cracker Barrel is unable to capitalize on this recovery, it may face revenue challenges.
2. **Consumer Behavior**: Rising inflation and economic uncertainty may lead consumers to cut back on discretionary spending, which could negatively impact restaurant revenues, including Cracker Barrel's.

### Economic Conditions
1. **Inflation and Consumer Spending**: High inflation rates have been affecting consumer purchasing power. If this trend continues into Q1 FY2026, it could lead to a decline in revenues for Cracker Barrel.
2. **Labor Costs**: Increasing labor costs in the restaurant industry may also impact profitability and revenue growth.

### Expert Opinions and Consensus Views
1. **Analyst Forecasts**: Analysts' expectations for Cracker Barrel's performance in FY2026 will be crucial. If the consensus is that revenues will decline due to economic pressures, this could support a "Yes" resolution.
2. **Competitor Performance**: Monitoring the performance of similar restaurant chains can provide context. If competitors are also experiencing revenue declines, it may indicate broader industry challenges.

### Missing Factors
1. **New Initiatives**: Any new menu items, marketing campaigns, or expansion plans that Cracker Barrel may implement could positively influence revenues.
2. **Seasonal Variations**: The impact of seasonal trends on dining out during the fall months should be considered, as they can significantly affect revenue.

### Conclusion
Based on the current information, the resolution of the question hinges on several uncertain factors, including economic conditions, consumer behavior, and Cracker Barrel's strategic initiatives. If economic pressures continue and consumer spending declines, it is plausible that Cracker Barrel's revenues in Q1 FY2026 could be less than the $845.089 million reported in Q1 FY2025. However, any positive developments or changes in consumer behavior could counteract this trend.

In summary, while there are indicators that suggest a potential decline in revenues, the outcome remains uncertain and will depend on various dynamic factors leading up to Q1 FY2026.

To assess whether the community prediction for the Metaculus question "Will Spirit Airlines emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy before 2026?" will be higher than 6.00% on September 24, 2025, we need to consider several factors, including the current status of Spirit Airlines, expert opinions, and the broader context of airline bankruptcies.

### Current Status of Spirit Airlines
1. **Bankruptcy Filing**: Spirit Airlines filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in July 2023. The airline has been restructuring its operations and finances to emerge from bankruptcy.
2. **Restructuring Progress**: As of now, Spirit has made some progress in its restructuring efforts, including renegotiating contracts and reducing debt. However, the timeline for emerging from bankruptcy remains uncertain.

### Expert Opinions
1. **Industry Analysts**: Many analysts believe that the airline industry is recovering post-pandemic, but the pace of recovery varies by airline. Spirit's low-cost model may provide some resilience, but it also faces significant competition and operational challenges.
2. **Bankruptcy Experts**: Experts in bankruptcy proceedings suggest that the timeline for emerging from Chapter 11 can be lengthy, often taking several months to years, depending on the complexity of the restructuring and market conditions.

### Base Rates and Historical Context
1. **Airline Bankruptcies**: Historically, airlines that file for Chapter 11 often take a considerable amount of time to emerge, with many not successfully doing so. However, some airlines have successfully restructured and emerged stronger.
2. **Community Predictions**: The current community prediction on Metaculus for Spirit Airlines emerging from bankruptcy is likely influenced by recent news and sentiment regarding the airline's restructuring efforts.

### Consensus Views
1. **Market Sentiment**: The sentiment around Spirit Airlines is mixed. While some believe in its potential to emerge successfully, others are cautious due to the competitive landscape and operational challenges.
2. **Community Engagement**: The Metaculus community tends to be informed and responsive to new information, which could lead to fluctuations in predictions as new developments occur.

### Missing Factors
1. **External Economic Conditions**: The broader economic environment, including fuel prices, labor costs, and consumer demand, will significantly impact Spirit's ability to emerge from bankruptcy.
2. **Regulatory Changes**: Any changes in regulations affecting the airline industry could also influence the community's perception and prediction.

### Conclusion
Given the current information, the community prediction on September 24, 2025, will depend heavily on the progress Spirit Airlines makes in its restructuring and the overall sentiment in the airline industry. If the airline shows significant signs of recovery and positive developments, it is plausible that the community prediction could exceed 6.00%. However, if challenges persist, the prediction may remain below this threshold.

In summary, while there is potential for the community prediction to be higher than 6.00%, it is contingent on various factors that could evolve over the next two years. Therefore, the resolution of the question remains uncertain at this time.

### Current Context on Crude Oil Prices (Brent - Europe)

#### Recent Trends and Current Prices
- As of late October 2023, Brent crude oil prices have been fluctuating around $90 to $95 per barrel, influenced by various geopolitical tensions, OPEC+ production decisions, and global economic conditions.
- The market has been reacting to supply constraints, particularly due to ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and production cuts by major oil-producing nations.

#### Geopolitical Influences
- The Israel-Hamas conflict has raised concerns about potential disruptions in oil supply from the Middle East, contributing to price volatility.
- OPEC+ has maintained production cuts to stabilize prices, which could continue to influence Brent prices through 2025.

#### Economic Factors
- Global economic recovery post-COVID-19 has led to increased demand for oil, but concerns about inflation and potential recessions in major economies (like the U.S. and Europe) could dampen demand.
- The transition to renewable energy sources and government policies aimed at reducing fossil fuel dependency may also impact long-term oil prices.

#### Expert Opinions
- Analysts are divided on the future trajectory of oil prices. Some predict a gradual increase due to ongoing supply constraints, while others foresee a potential decline if global economic conditions worsen.
- A consensus among energy economists suggests that prices may stabilize around current levels unless significant geopolitical or economic changes occur.

#### Base Rates and Historical Context
- Historically, Brent crude prices have shown significant volatility, influenced by both supply-demand dynamics and external shocks (e.g., geopolitical events, natural disasters).
- The average price of Brent crude over the past decade has been approximately $60 to $70 per barrel, with spikes during crises.

#### Missing Factors
- Potential technological advancements in energy extraction and alternative energy sources could disrupt traditional oil markets.
- Changes in regulatory frameworks regarding carbon emissions and climate change initiatives may also play a role in shaping future oil prices.

### Resolution Criteria
- The question will resolve based on the value found on the FRED API for the series DCOILBRENTEU on the specified date (2025-09-24).
- The API updates daily, so a data point for September 23, 2025, or September 24, 2025, will be necessary for resolution.
- If no data point is found within the specified timeframe (1 day prior), the question will be annulled.

### Conclusion
Given the current information, the outcome of the question hinges on future developments in geopolitical situations, economic conditions, and OPEC+ decisions leading up to September 2025. The resolution will depend on the availability of the Brent crude oil price data on the specified date, which is uncertain at this time.

To assess the likelihood of Omar Fateh being elected mayor of Minneapolis in 2025, we need to consider several factors, including his current political standing, the political landscape of Minneapolis, and relevant historical trends.

### Current Political Context
1. **Omar Fateh's Background**: Omar Fateh is a current member of the Minnesota House of Representatives, representing District 62A. He has been in office since 2019 and is known for his progressive stance on various issues, including housing, public safety, and social justice.

2. **Recent Elections**: The 2021 Minneapolis mayoral election saw incumbent Jacob Frey win re-election amid significant public discourse on police reform and public safety following the George Floyd incident. Frey is a centrist Democrat, and his administration has faced criticism from both the left and right.

3. **Political Climate**: Minneapolis has a history of progressive politics, but it also has a significant centrist and moderate voter base. The political landscape may shift leading up to the 2025 election, especially if issues like public safety, housing, and economic recovery remain prominent.

### Key Factors Influencing Fateh's Candidacy
1. **Support Base**: Fateh's support among progressive voters could be a significant asset. However, he will need to broaden his appeal to moderate voters to secure a win in a general election.

2. **Potential Opponents**: The identity and political stance of potential opponents will be crucial. If Frey runs for re-election, he may have an advantage due to incumbency. Other candidates may emerge, which could split the vote among progressive candidates.

3. **Voter Turnout**: Turnout in municipal elections can be variable. High turnout among young and progressive voters could benefit Fateh, while low turnout could hinder his chances.

### Expert Opinions and Consensus Views
- **Political Analysts**: Some analysts suggest that Fateh's progressive platform aligns well with the current trends in Minneapolis, especially among younger voters. However, they caution that he must address broader concerns about public safety and economic issues to appeal to a wider electorate.
  
- **Polling Data**: As of now, there are no specific polls for the 2025 election, but historical data shows that incumbents often have an advantage. If Frey decides to run again, he may have a strong chance of winning.

### Missing Factors
- **Emerging Issues**: The political landscape can change rapidly. Issues such as crime rates, economic recovery post-pandemic, and housing affordability will be critical in shaping voter sentiment.
  
- **Campaign Strategy**: Fateh's campaign strategy, including fundraising and outreach efforts, will significantly impact his chances. His ability to connect with a diverse voter base will be essential.

### Conclusion
Based on the current information, the outcome of whether Omar Fateh will be elected mayor of Minneapolis in 2025 remains uncertain. While he has a solid progressive base, the political dynamics, potential opponents, and key issues leading up to the election will play a crucial role in determining the outcome. As of now, it is too early to definitively say whether the answer will be **Yes** or **No**. Further developments, particularly regarding potential challengers and the political climate closer to the election, will be critical in making a more informed assessment.

To assess the likelihood of whether at least twice as many deportations by U.S. ICE will occur in Fiscal Year 2025 compared to Fiscal Year 2024, we need to consider several factors, including current trends, policy changes, and expert opinions.

### Current Data
- **FY 2024 Deportations**: The reported number for FY 2024 is 271,484 (all Title 8 removals, with no Title 42 expulsions).
- **Threshold for FY 2025**: To resolve the question as **Yes**, ICE must report at least 542,968 deportations for FY 2025.

### Recent Trends and Context
1. **Historical Context**: The number of deportations has fluctuated significantly over the years, influenced by changes in administration policies, enforcement priorities, and external factors such as migration patterns.
2. **FY 2023 Data**: For context, ICE reported approximately 300,000 deportations in FY 2023, which indicates a potential downward trend in deportations compared to previous years.
3. **Policy Changes**: The Biden administration has focused on prioritizing deportations of individuals with serious criminal records, which may lead to fewer overall deportations. Any shifts in policy or enforcement priorities could significantly impact the numbers for FY 2025.

### Expert Opinions
- **Immigration Policy Analysts**: Many experts suggest that the current administration's approach to immigration enforcement is less aggressive than previous administrations, which could hinder the likelihood of reaching the threshold for FY 2025.
- **Migration Trends**: Analysts are also observing increasing migration pressures from Central America and other regions, which could lead to higher apprehension rates but may not necessarily translate into deportations if policies remain focused on humanitarian considerations.

### Base Rates and Consensus Views
- **Base Rates**: Historically, the number of deportations has not consistently doubled year over year. The average annual deportations have varied widely, making it difficult to predict a doubling without significant policy shifts.
- **Consensus Views**: Current consensus among immigration experts leans towards a cautious outlook for FY 2025, with many believing that the deportation numbers are unlikely to double due to ongoing policy constraints and changing enforcement priorities.

### Missing Factors
- **Legislative Changes**: Potential changes in immigration law or funding for ICE could impact deportation numbers. If Congress were to pass legislation that increases enforcement resources or alters priorities, this could lead to a significant increase in deportations.
- **Judicial Decisions**: Court rulings on immigration policy could also affect ICE's operational capacity and priorities, potentially leading to an increase or decrease in deportations.

### Conclusion
Based on the current information, the likelihood of ICE reporting at least 542,968 deportations for FY 2025 appears low given the historical context, expert opinions, and current policy trends. The question is likely to resolve as **No**, unless there are significant and unforeseen changes in immigration enforcement policy or external factors that dramatically increase deportation numbers.

To provide a detailed rundown for the question regarding the value of "Market Yield on U.S. Treasury Securities at 5-Year Constant Maturity, Quoted on an Investment Basis, Inflation-Indexed" (series DFII5) on 2025-09-25, here are the relevant points to consider:

### Current Context and Trends
1. **Interest Rate Environment**: As of late 2023, the U.S. Federal Reserve has been navigating a complex economic landscape characterized by high inflation and fluctuating interest rates. The Fed's decisions on interest rates directly influence Treasury yields. Recent signals from the Fed suggest a cautious approach to rate hikes, with a focus on stabilizing inflation.

2. **Inflation Trends**: Inflation rates have shown signs of moderation, but core inflation remains a concern. The market yield on inflation-indexed securities is sensitive to inflation expectations. If inflation continues to stabilize or decrease, it could lead to lower yields on Treasury securities.

3. **Market Sentiment**: Investor sentiment towards U.S. Treasury securities has been mixed, with some investors seeking safety in government bonds amid economic uncertainty. This demand can affect yields, typically driving them lower.

### Expert Opinions
- **Economists and Analysts**: Many economists predict that yields on Treasury securities will remain relatively stable in the near term, with potential for slight decreases if inflation continues to cool. However, unexpected economic data could lead to volatility.
- **Market Analysts**: Analysts are closely watching the Fed's communications and economic indicators, which could influence Treasury yields leading up to the specified date.

### Base Rates and Historical Context
- **Historical Yields**: Historically, the 5-year Treasury yield has fluctuated based on economic conditions. Reviewing past data can provide insights into potential future movements, but current conditions are unique due to the post-pandemic economic recovery and geopolitical factors.

### Missing Factors
- **Geopolitical Events**: Any significant geopolitical developments (e.g., conflicts, trade agreements) could impact investor confidence and, consequently, Treasury yields.
- **Economic Data Releases**: Key economic indicators (e.g., employment reports, GDP growth) released before the resolution date could significantly influence market expectations and yield movements.

### Bayesian Updating
- As new data becomes available (e.g., inflation reports, Fed announcements), it will be crucial to adjust expectations regarding the yield on the specified date. Continuous monitoring of economic indicators will be necessary for accurate forecasting.

### Fermi-Style Breakdown
- **Factors Influencing Yield**: 
  - Current inflation rate
  - Federal Reserve interest rate policy
  - Economic growth indicators
  - Market demand for Treasury securities
- **Expected Yield Range**: Based on current trends, analysts might estimate a range for the yield, but precise predictions will depend on the evolving economic landscape.

### Conclusion
The outcome of the question hinges on the availability of the data point for DFII5 on or before 2025-09-25. Given the current updates and the frequency of data publication, it is likely that a relevant data point will be available. However, the exact yield value will depend on the economic conditions leading up to that date. 

In summary, while the question is likely to resolve with a data point, the specific yield value will be influenced by a variety of economic factors and market conditions leading up to the resolution date. Continuous monitoring of these factors will be essential for understanding potential outcomes.

To assess whether the community prediction for the Metaculus question "Will the United States attack Venezuela before 2026?" will be higher than 20.00% on September 26, 2025, we need to consider several factors, including current geopolitical dynamics, expert opinions, and historical context.

### Current Geopolitical Context
1. **U.S.-Venezuela Relations**: The relationship between the U.S. and Venezuela has been tense, particularly under the Maduro regime. The U.S. has imposed sanctions on Venezuela and has expressed support for opposition groups. However, direct military action has not been a prominent part of U.S. policy in recent years.

2. **Military Engagements**: The U.S. has been involved in various military engagements globally, but there has been a general trend towards avoiding new conflicts, especially in Latin America, where diplomatic solutions are often preferred.

3. **Regional Stability**: The situation in Venezuela is complex, with economic collapse, humanitarian crises, and political instability. However, the U.S. has typically opted for sanctions and diplomatic pressure rather than military intervention.

### Expert Opinions
- **Political Analysts**: Many analysts believe that while the U.S. may continue to exert pressure on Venezuela through sanctions and diplomatic means, a direct military attack is unlikely. The risks of escalation and international backlash are significant deterrents.
- **Military Experts**: Experts in military strategy often argue that the U.S. is more likely to engage in covert operations or support for opposition forces rather than a full-scale military attack.

### Historical Context
- **Past U.S. Interventions**: Historically, U.S. interventions in Latin America have often been covert or through support of local forces rather than direct military action. The last significant military intervention in the region was in the early 2000s, and the trend has shifted towards non-military solutions.

### Community Sentiment and Prediction Trends
- **Metaculus Community Predictions**: As of now, the community prediction for this question is likely influenced by the prevailing sentiment regarding U.S. foreign policy. If the community perceives a low likelihood of military action, the prediction may remain below 20.00%. Conversely, if there are significant developments (e.g., escalations in rhetoric or military posturing), the prediction could rise.

### Missing Factors
- **Future Developments**: Any significant changes in U.S. foreign policy, such as a new administration with a more aggressive stance towards Venezuela, could influence community predictions. Additionally, unexpected events in Venezuela (e.g., a coup or major civil unrest) could also shift perceptions.

### Conclusion
Based on the current geopolitical context, expert opinions, and historical trends, it seems unlikely that the U.S. will attack Venezuela before 2026. Therefore, the community prediction is likely to remain below 20.00%. However, this assessment is subject to change based on future developments. 

**Resolution Criteria**: If the community prediction on September 26, 2025, is higher than 20.00%, the question will resolve to 'Yes'. Given the current information, it appears more probable that the prediction will be below this threshold, suggesting a 'No' resolution. However, ongoing monitoring of geopolitical developments is essential for accurate forecasting.

To assess whether the community prediction for the Metaculus question regarding a potential investigation or prosecution of a Democrat who served in a high-ranking position will exceed 35.00% by September 27, 2025, we need to consider several factors, including current political dynamics, historical context, expert opinions, and community sentiment.

### Current Political Context
1. **Political Climate**: As of now, the political landscape in the U.S. is highly polarized. Investigations and prosecutions of political figures, especially from opposing parties, have become more common. The Biden administration has faced scrutiny, and there are ongoing discussions about the accountability of past administrations.
  
2. **Recent Developments**: There have been various investigations into former President Trump and other high-profile Democrats. The outcomes of these investigations could influence public sentiment and the likelihood of future investigations into Democrats.

3. **Public Sentiment**: The public's perception of the Department of Justice (DOJ) and its impartiality is crucial. If the DOJ is perceived as politically motivated, this could lead to increased predictions of investigations against Democrats.

### Expert Opinions
- **Legal Experts**: Many legal analysts suggest that while the DOJ has the authority to investigate any individual, the political ramifications of prosecuting a former president or high-ranking official are significant. This could deter the DOJ from pursuing such actions unless there is overwhelming evidence.
  
- **Political Analysts**: Some analysts believe that the likelihood of a high-profile investigation or prosecution is low, given the potential backlash and the current administration's focus on other priorities.

### Base Rates and Historical Context
- **Historical Precedents**: Historically, investigations into high-ranking officials have been rare, especially for those from the same party as the sitting president. The last significant investigation into a sitting or former president was the impeachment of Bill Clinton, which did not lead to criminal prosecution.

- **Community Predictions**: The current community prediction on Metaculus for this question can provide insight into how the community views the likelihood of such an event. If the prediction is currently below 35%, it may indicate skepticism about the DOJ's willingness to pursue such cases.

### Missing Factors
- **Future Events**: Any significant political events, such as upcoming elections, changes in public opinion, or new evidence emerging, could dramatically shift community predictions. 

- **Influence of Media**: The role of media coverage in shaping public perception and community predictions should not be underestimated. High-profile media narratives can sway community sentiment significantly.

### Conclusion
As of now, the community prediction's trajectory will depend heavily on the evolving political landscape, public sentiment towards the DOJ, and any significant developments leading up to the resolution date. If the community sentiment leans towards skepticism about the likelihood of investigations or prosecutions, it may remain below 35.00%. Conversely, if political tensions rise and public sentiment shifts towards expecting accountability, the prediction could exceed that threshold.

In summary, while current information suggests a cautious approach to predicting a community forecast above 35.00%, ongoing developments will be critical in shaping the final outcome.

2. **Game Releases and Announcements**: The timing of major game releases or announcements can significantly impact search interest. If a highly anticipated game is set to release shortly after September 26, it could drive more interest in "nintendo direct" on that date. Monitoring upcoming game releases around that time is crucial.

3. **Seasonal Trends**: Interest in gaming often fluctuates with seasonal trends, such as the holiday season or major gaming events (e.g., E3, Tokyo Game Show). September is typically a month where companies ramp up marketing for holiday releases, which could influence search trends.

4. **Social Media and Community Buzz**: The gaming community's engagement on platforms like Twitter, Reddit, and gaming forums can also affect search interest. If there is a lot of discussion or speculation about a Nintendo Direct leading up to September 26, this could increase search interest.

5. **Historical Data**: Looking at past trends for "nintendo direct" around similar times (e.g., previous September months) can provide insights into typical interest levels. If historical data shows a pattern of increased interest in late September, this could support a "Yes" resolution.

### Expert Opinions and Consensus Views

- **Gaming Analysts**: Analysts often predict spikes in interest around major announcements or events. If there are rumors or leaks about a Nintendo Direct, analysts may expect increased search interest.
- **Community Sentiment**: Engaging with community sentiment on platforms like Reddit or Twitter can provide qualitative insights into whether fans are anticipating a Nintendo Direct.

### Missing Factors

- **Unforeseen Announcements**: Any surprise announcements or events could drastically change interest levels.
- **External Events**: Broader events in the gaming industry or global events could also impact search interest.

### Conclusion

As of now, without specific announcements or events leading up to September 2025, it is difficult to predict with certainty whether interest will be greater on September 26 than on September 17. The outcome will heavily depend on any developments in the gaming world leading up to those dates. 

To resolve the question, the Google Trends data will ultimately provide the definitive answer based on the search interest values for the specified dates. If the data shows an increase on September 26 compared to September 17, it will resolve to "Yes"; otherwise, it will resolve to "No".

### Current Context and Trends
1. **Recent Events**: Interest in public figures like Ben Shapiro can be influenced by current events, media appearances, or controversies. Monitoring any upcoming events, debates, or significant media coverage related to Shapiro leading up to September 2025 is crucial. As of now, there are no major events scheduled that are widely known to impact his visibility.

2. **Political Climate**: Shapiro is a prominent conservative commentator, and interest in him may spike during election cycles or significant political events. The 2024 U.S. presidential election will have concluded by September 2025, and the political landscape may still be a topic of discussion, potentially affecting his relevance.

3. **Social Media and Content Production**: Shapiro's engagement on platforms like YouTube, Twitter, and podcasts can drive interest. If he releases new content or engages in high-profile discussions around this time, it could lead to increased search interest.

### Expert Opinions and Consensus
- **Media Analysts**: Experts in media trends suggest that interest in political commentators often correlates with their visibility in mainstream media and social media engagement. If Shapiro is active and relevant in discussions, interest is likely to increase.
- **Political Analysts**: Given the political climate post-2024 election, analysts suggest that figures like Shapiro may see fluctuating interest based on ongoing political discourse.

### Missing Factors
- **Unforeseen Events**: Any unexpected events, such as a major controversy or a significant political event, could dramatically alter interest levels.
- **Cultural Shifts**: Changes in public sentiment or shifts in the political landscape could also impact how figures like Shapiro are perceived and searched for.

### Conclusion

To assess whether the community prediction for the Metaculus question "Will the IBEX 35 close 2025 higher than it started?" will be higher than 95.00% on 2025-09-27, we need to consider several factors, including current market conditions, expert opinions, historical performance, and potential influences on the IBEX 35 index.

### Current Market Conditions
1. **IBEX 35 Performance**: As of now, the IBEX 35 index has shown fluctuations influenced by various factors, including economic recovery post-COVID-19, inflation rates, and geopolitical tensions in Europe. The index's performance in 2025 will depend on the broader economic environment, including Spain's economic growth, corporate earnings, and investor sentiment.

2. **Economic Indicators**: Key indicators such as GDP growth, unemployment rates, and inflation in Spain and the Eurozone will play a significant role in shaping the IBEX 35's trajectory. If these indicators show positive trends, it could lead to a higher community prediction.

### Expert Opinions
1. **Market Analysts**: Analysts' forecasts for the IBEX 35 in 2025 vary, with some predicting growth due to recovery in sectors like tourism and energy, while others express caution due to potential economic headwinds. Consensus views suggest a moderate optimism, but with significant uncertainty.

2. **Geopolitical Factors**: The ongoing geopolitical situation in Europe, including the impact of the Ukraine conflict and EU policies, could influence investor confidence and market performance. Experts are divided on how these factors will play out over the next couple of years.

### Historical Performance and Base Rates
1. **Historical Trends**: Historically, the IBEX 35 has shown resilience in recovery phases, but it has also faced significant downturns during economic crises. Analyzing past performance during similar economic conditions could provide insights into potential outcomes.

2. **Base Rates**: Looking at historical data, the IBEX 35 has closed higher than its starting point in approximately 60-70% of years following economic recoveries. This base rate suggests that while a positive outcome is plausible, it is not guaranteed.

### Missing Factors/Influences
1. **Global Economic Conditions**: The impact of global economic trends, such as interest rates in the U.S. and China’s economic performance, could significantly influence the IBEX 35. These factors may not be fully accounted for in current predictions.

2. **Investor Sentiment**: The psychological aspect of investor behavior can lead to overreactions to news, which may not be reflected in current forecasts. A sudden shift in sentiment could push community predictions higher or lower.

### Bayesian Updating
As new information becomes available, particularly regarding economic indicators and geopolitical developments, the community's prediction may adjust. Monitoring these developments will be crucial in assessing the likelihood of the prediction exceeding 95.00%.

### Conclusion
Given the current information, it is uncertain whether the community prediction will exceed 95.00% on 2025-09-27. While there is a possibility of a positive outcome based on economic recovery and expert optimism, significant uncertainties remain. The resolution of this question will depend heavily on the evolving economic landscape and investor sentiment leading up to that date. 

In summary, the question remains open, and ongoing monitoring of relevant factors will be essential for a more accurate assessment as the date approaches.

To assess whether at least one 2025 WNBA semifinal series will end in a sweep (3-0), we need to consider several factors, including team performance, historical trends, and expert opinions.

### Current Context and Relevant News

1. **WNBA Structure and Playoff Format**: The WNBA playoffs typically consist of a best-of-five series format for the semifinals. This means that a team must win three games to advance. Historically, sweeps in the semifinals are relatively rare but not unheard of.

2. **Historical Data**: 
   - In recent years, the WNBA playoffs have seen a mix of competitive series and occasional sweeps. For instance, in the 2021 and 2022 playoffs, there were no sweeps in the semifinals, while in 2020, the Seattle Storm swept the Minnesota Lynx.
   - The frequency of sweeps can be influenced by the relative strength of the teams involved, with stronger teams more likely to dominate weaker opponents.

3. **Team Performance and Projections**: 
   - As of now, the 2025 season is not yet underway, but projections based on team rosters, player performance, and coaching changes will be crucial. Teams with strong regular-season records and dominant players are more likely to sweep in the playoffs.
   - Analysts and experts often look at metrics such as point differentials, win-loss records, and head-to-head matchups to gauge potential playoff outcomes.

4. **Expert Opinions**: 
   - Analysts from sports networks and WNBA commentators often provide insights into team dynamics and playoff potential. If a consensus emerges that certain teams are significantly stronger than their opponents, this could increase the likelihood of a sweep.
   - Injuries, player trades, and mid-season performance can also heavily influence playoff outcomes, making it essential to monitor these factors as the season progresses.

5. **Missing Factors**: 
   - Potential upsets are a critical factor that could lead to unexpected outcomes in the playoffs. The unpredictability of playoff basketball means that even lower-seeded teams can perform well against higher-seeded teams.
   - The impact of home-court advantage, fan support, and player experience in high-pressure situations can also play a role in determining whether a series ends in a sweep.

### Conclusion

Based on the current information and historical trends, it is too early to definitively predict whether at least one 2025 WNBA semifinal series will end in a sweep. The outcome will depend on the performance of the teams leading up to the playoffs, expert analyses, and unforeseen circumstances such as injuries or trades. 

**Resolution Criteria**: The question will resolve as "Yes" if at least one semifinal series ends in a 3-0 result, and "No" if all series go to at least four games. As of now, the answer remains uncertain, pending the developments in the 2025 season.

To assess whether the community prediction for the Metaculus question "Will Paul Biya be reelected President of Cameroon in 2025?" will be higher than 95.00% on September 26, 2025, we need to consider several factors, including the current political landscape in Cameroon, Biya's historical performance, expert opinions, and the general sentiment within the Metaculus community.

### Current Political Landscape
1. **Paul Biya's Tenure**: Paul Biya has been in power since 1982, making him one of the longest-serving leaders in the world. His administration has faced criticism for authoritarian practices, human rights abuses, and a lack of political pluralism.
   
2. **Upcoming Election**: The presidential election in Cameroon is scheduled for October 2025. As the incumbent, Biya is likely to run for reelection, but his age (he will be 93 by the election) raises questions about his viability as a candidate.

3. **Opposition Dynamics**: The political opposition in Cameroon has historically been fragmented. However, there are emerging figures and parties that could challenge Biya's rule. The effectiveness of the opposition in mobilizing support will be crucial.

4. **Public Sentiment**: There is significant public discontent regarding economic conditions, governance, and security issues, particularly in the Anglophone regions. This discontent could influence voter turnout and preferences.

### Expert Opinions
- **Political Analysts**: Some analysts suggest that Biya's long-standing control over the political apparatus and security forces may allow him to maintain power despite public dissatisfaction. Others argue that the growing opposition and civil unrest could pose a significant challenge to his reelection.
  
- **International Observers**: The international community's stance on the election, including potential sanctions or support for democratic processes, could impact the election's outcome.

### Metaculus Community Sentiment
- **Current Prediction Trends**: As of now, the community prediction on Metaculus may reflect a cautious optimism regarding Biya's reelection, but it is essential to monitor how this sentiment evolves as the election date approaches. If the community perceives a strong likelihood of Biya's reelection, the prediction could trend upwards.

### Missing Factors
- **Health and Viability**: Biya's health and ability to campaign effectively will be critical. Any significant health issues could lead to a shift in community predictions.
  
- **Election Integrity**: The perceived fairness of the electoral process and the potential for violence or unrest could also influence community sentiment.

### Conclusion
Given the current information, it is uncertain whether the community prediction will exceed 95.00% on September 26, 2025. While Biya's incumbency and historical control suggest a strong chance of reelection, factors such as public discontent, opposition strength, and his health will play significant roles. The community's prediction will likely fluctuate as these dynamics evolve leading up to the election. 

**Resolution Criteria**: The question will resolve to 'Yes' if the community prediction is above 95.00% on the specified date. As of now, it is too early to definitively state whether this will be the case, but the situation warrants close monitoring.

To provide a detailed rundown for the question regarding the value of "Overnight Reverse Repurchase Agreements: Total Securities Sold by the Federal Reserve in the Temporary Open Market Operations" on 2025-09-24, we need to consider several factors:

### Current Context and Background
1. **Understanding Overnight Reverse Repurchase Agreements (RRP)**:
   - RRPs are a tool used by the Federal Reserve to manage liquidity in the financial system. They allow the Fed to sell securities with an agreement to repurchase them later, effectively absorbing excess reserves from the banking system.

2. **Recent Trends**:
   - As of late 2023, the use of RRPs has been significant, especially in a high-interest rate environment. The Fed has been utilizing RRPs to help control short-term interest rates and manage the supply of reserves in the banking system.

3. **Historical Data**:
   - Historical data on RRPs can provide insights into typical values and trends. The FRED API provides access to this data, which can be analyzed for patterns leading up to the specified date.

### Expert Opinions and Consensus Views
- **Economists and Analysts**: Many economists believe that the Fed will continue to use RRPs as a tool for monetary policy, especially if inflation remains a concern and interest rates are kept elevated. The consensus suggests that RRPs will likely remain a significant part of the Fed's toolkit through 2025.
- **Market Sentiment**: Financial markets are closely monitoring the Fed's actions regarding RRPs, as they can influence liquidity and interest rates. Any changes in the Fed's approach could impact the expected value of RRPs.

### Base Rates and Historical Context
- **Base Rates**: Analyzing the historical average values of RRPs can provide a baseline for expectations. For instance, if the average value over the past few years has been around a certain level, it may inform expectations for future values.
- **Recent Data Trends**: If recent data shows a consistent increase or decrease in RRP values, this trend may continue unless there are significant changes in monetary policy or economic conditions.

### Missing Factors and Influences
- **Monetary Policy Changes**: Any unexpected changes in the Fed's monetary policy, such as rate hikes or changes in asset purchases, could significantly impact RRP values.
- **Economic Indicators**: Key economic indicators (e.g., inflation rates, employment data) leading up to September 2025 could influence the Fed's decisions and, consequently, the RRP values.

### Bayesian Updating
- As new data becomes available, particularly regarding economic conditions and Fed policy, it will be essential to update expectations for the RRP values. This includes monitoring any announcements from the Fed and economic reports that could affect liquidity and interest rates.

### Conclusion
- The resolution of the question hinges on the availability of the RRP data point for the date of 2025-09-24. Given the current understanding of the Fed's operations and the historical context, it is likely that a data point will be available, as the series is updated daily. However, if there are significant changes in policy or economic conditions, this could affect the expected value.

In summary, while the current information suggests that a data point will likely be available for the specified date, ongoing monitoring of economic conditions and Fed policy will be crucial for accurate forecasting.

To assess the likelihood of California's Proposition 50 passing in the 2025 election, we need to consider several factors, including the current political landscape, public opinion, expert analysis, and historical voting patterns on similar measures.

### Current Context
1. **Proposition 50 Overview**: Proposition 50 aims to allow for the redistricting of House seats in California. This measure is significant as it could impact political representation and party power dynamics within the state.

2. **Political Climate**: As of now, California's political landscape is predominantly Democratic, with the party holding a supermajority in the state legislature. This could influence the support for redistricting measures, as Democrats may be wary of changes that could threaten their dominance.

3. **Public Opinion**: Recent polling data on redistricting measures in California shows mixed results. While there is a general awareness of the need for fair representation, opinions on specific redistricting proposals can vary widely. It would be essential to monitor upcoming polls as the election date approaches to gauge public sentiment.

### Expert Opinions
- **Political Analysts**: Experts suggest that redistricting measures often face challenges due to partisan interests. Analysts note that if Proposition 50 is perceived as benefiting one party over another, it may struggle to gain broad support.
- **Historical Precedents**: Looking at past propositions related to redistricting, such as Proposition 11 (2008) and Proposition 20 (2010), both of which aimed to change the redistricting process, can provide insights. Proposition 11 passed with 50.9% of the vote, while Proposition 20, which expanded the independent commission's role, passed with 61.0%. This history indicates that while redistricting measures can pass, they often require significant public support and clear messaging.

### Base Rates and Consensus Views
- **Base Rates**: Historically, California voters have shown a willingness to support redistricting reforms, especially when framed as a means to enhance fairness and reduce gerrymandering. However, the success of such measures often hinges on the political context at the time of the vote.
- **Consensus Views**: Currently, there is no strong consensus on the likelihood of Proposition 50 passing. Some political commentators believe that if the measure is framed effectively and garners bipartisan support, it could succeed. Others caution that partisan divisions may hinder its chances.

### Missing Factors
- **Campaign Dynamics**: The effectiveness of the campaign advocating for Proposition 50 will be crucial. Factors such as funding, endorsements from influential groups, and grassroots mobilization efforts will play a significant role in shaping voter perceptions.
- **Voter Turnout**: The demographics of voters who turn out for the 2025 election will also impact the measure's chances. Higher turnout among younger and more progressive voters could favor the proposition, while lower turnout among these groups could hinder its success.

To assess the question of whether interest in "Erika Kirk" will be greater on September 26, 2025, than on September 16, 2025, according to Google Trends, we need to consider several factors that could influence search interest over this period.

### Current Context and Relevant News
1. **Public Interest and Events**: 
   - Investigate if there are any upcoming events, news stories, or social media trends related to Erika Kirk that could drive interest. This could include public appearances, media coverage, or any controversies.
   - If Erika Kirk is a public figure, check for any scheduled events or releases (e.g., a book, movie, or album) around these dates that could spike interest.

4. **Competitor Analysis**: 
   - Consider if there are other trending topics or figures that might overshadow Erika Kirk during this time. If another event or figure captures public attention, it could negatively impact her search interest.

### Expert Opinions and Consensus Views
- **Domain Experts**: Seek insights from social media analysts or trend forecasters who might provide context on how public interest can shift rapidly based on external factors.
- **Consensus Views**: Look for any articles or reports discussing anticipated trends in public interest for the latter half of September 2025.

- **Cultural Context**: Consider any cultural or societal events occurring around that time that could influence search behavior.

### Bayesian Updating
- As new information becomes available, be prepared to adjust expectations. For instance, if a major event related to Erika Kirk is announced shortly before September 26, this could significantly increase interest.

### Conclusion
At this stage, without specific data from Google Trends for the dates in question, it is impossible to definitively predict the outcome. However, by monitoring the factors outlined above, you can better gauge the likelihood of increased interest in "Erika Kirk" on September 26 compared to September 16.

To assess the likelihood of increased interest in "Netanyahu" on September 26, 2025, compared to September 16, 2025, we need to consider several factors that could influence public interest and search trends during this period.

### Current Context and Relevant News

1. **Political Climate in Israel**: As of late 2023, Benjamin Netanyahu remains a significant figure in Israeli politics, having returned to power in late 2022. His government has faced various challenges, including internal political strife, protests against judicial reforms, and ongoing tensions with Palestinian groups. Any developments in these areas could spike public interest.

2. **Upcoming Events**: The timeline leading up to September 2025 may include significant political events, such as elections, international summits, or major policy announcements. If Netanyahu is involved in any high-profile events or controversies during this time, it could lead to increased search interest.

3. **Media Coverage**: The level of media coverage surrounding Netanyahu will also play a crucial role. If there are major news stories, interviews, or controversies involving him in the days leading up to September 26, this could drive up search interest.

4. **Public Sentiment and Social Media**: Public sentiment towards Netanyahu, influenced by social media trends and public opinion polls, could also affect search interest. If there is a notable shift in public opinion or a viral moment related to him, this could lead to increased searches.

### Expert Opinions and Consensus Views

- **Political Analysts**: Experts suggest that Netanyahu's political maneuvers and the stability of his government will be closely watched, especially if there are signs of instability or significant policy changes.
- **Media Analysts**: They indicate that spikes in interest often correlate with major news events or controversies, suggesting that if Netanyahu is in the news for any reason, interest will likely increase.

### Base Rates and Historical Trends

- **Historical Data**: Analyzing past Google Trends data for Netanyahu during similar periods (e.g., election cycles, major policy announcements) can provide insights. Typically, interest peaks during significant political events.
- **Seasonal Trends**: Interest in political figures can also be seasonal, with spikes often occurring during election seasons or major political events.

### Missing Factors

- **Unforeseen Events**: Unexpected events, such as international crises or domestic incidents, could dramatically alter interest levels.
- **Public Engagement**: The role of social media and grassroots movements in shaping public interest is often underestimated. Viral content can lead to sudden spikes in search interest.

### Conclusion

Given the current political landscape, potential upcoming events, and the historical context of interest in Netanyahu, there is a reasonable basis to expect fluctuations in search interest. However, without specific events or developments leading up to September 26, it is challenging to predict definitively whether interest will increase.

### Resolution Criteria

- The question will resolve "Yes" if the Google Trends data shows a higher interest level on September 26 compared to September 16.
- It will resolve "No" if the interest level is the same or lower.

In summary, while there are factors that could lead to increased interest in Netanyahu, the actual outcome will depend on specific events and media coverage leading up to the dates in question. Monitoring these developments will be crucial for a more accurate assessment as the dates approach.

To assess whether the community prediction for the Metaculus question "Will India's nominal GDP surpass Japan's by the end of 2025?" will be higher than 88.00% on 2025-09-26, we need to consider several factors, including current economic data, expert opinions, and trends in both countries' economies.

### Current Economic Context

1. **Nominal GDP Projections**:
   - As of 2023, India's nominal GDP is projected to grow significantly, with estimates suggesting it could reach around $3.5 trillion by the end of 2025.
   - Japan's nominal GDP is projected to be around $4.5 trillion by the end of 2025, but growth is expected to be slower due to demographic challenges and a stagnant economy.

2. **Growth Rates**:
   - India has been experiencing robust economic growth, with GDP growth rates often exceeding 6-7% annually. This is driven by factors such as a young population, increasing foreign investment, and a growing technology sector.
   - Japan, on the other hand, has been facing challenges such as an aging population, low birth rates, and deflationary pressures, which contribute to slower growth rates (around 1-2% annually).

### Expert Opinions

- **Economists and Analysts**: Many economists believe that India is on track to surpass Japan's nominal GDP by the end of 2025, given the current growth trajectories. However, some caution that unforeseen economic shocks (e.g., global recessions, geopolitical tensions) could impact these projections.
- **Market Sentiment**: Investor sentiment towards India remains positive, with many seeing it as a rising economic power. This could influence the Metaculus community's predictions positively.

### Community Prediction Trends

- **Metaculus Community Behavior**: The community tends to be optimistic about India's economic prospects, especially given the narrative of India as a fast-growing economy. If current trends continue, it is plausible that the community prediction could rise above 88.00%.
- **Historical Predictions**: Looking at past predictions for similar questions, the community has shown a tendency to adjust their forecasts based on new economic data and trends.

### Missing Factors

- **Global Economic Conditions**: Potential global economic downturns, inflation rates, and changes in trade policies could significantly impact both countries' GDPs.
- **Domestic Policies**: India's economic policies, reforms, and infrastructure developments will play a crucial role in sustaining growth. Any major policy changes or disruptions could affect predictions.

### Conclusion

Based on the current information, the community prediction for the Metaculus question is likely to trend towards optimism regarding India's GDP surpassing Japan's by the end of 2025. However, the final prediction on 2025-09-26 will depend on the economic conditions leading up to that date. If the growth trends continue and no significant negative events occur, it is plausible that the community prediction could exceed 88.00%. 

**Resolution Criteria**: The question will resolve to 'Yes' if the community prediction is higher than 88.00% on the specified date. Given the current trajectory and expert opinions, there is a reasonable chance that this will occur, but it remains contingent on various economic factors.

To assess whether the community prediction for the Metaculus question "Will Ali Khamenei cease to be supreme leader of Iran in 2025?" will be higher than 6.00% on 2025-09-25, we need to consider several factors, including current events, expert opinions, and the historical context surrounding Khamenei's leadership.

### Current Context
1. **Ali Khamenei's Health**: Reports have indicated that Khamenei, who has been in power since 1989, is in declining health. Speculation about his potential succession has increased, which could influence community predictions. If his health continues to deteriorate, it may lead to a higher likelihood of him ceasing to be supreme leader.

2. **Political Climate in Iran**: The political landscape in Iran is currently tense, with ongoing protests and dissatisfaction among the populace regarding economic conditions and government policies. This unrest could lead to increased speculation about leadership changes, potentially raising the community prediction.

3. **Succession Speculation**: Discussions about potential successors, such as Ebrahim Raisi or other influential figures within the Iranian political system, may also impact community sentiment. If there are credible signs of a succession plan or a power struggle, this could lead to a higher prediction.

### Expert Opinions
- **Political Analysts**: Many analysts believe that Khamenei's eventual departure is inevitable, but the timing is uncertain. Some suggest that if he were to pass away or step down, it could lead to significant changes in Iran's political structure, which might be reflected in the community prediction.
- **Iranian Studies Scholars**: Experts in Iranian politics often emphasize the unpredictability of leadership transitions in authoritarian regimes. They note that while Khamenei's health is a factor, the regime's ability to maintain stability could delay any leadership change.

### Base Rates and Historical Context
- Historically, transitions of power in Iran have been marked by significant events, such as the 2009 protests and the 2020 assassination of Qasem Soleimani. These events have often led to speculation about leadership changes, but Khamenei has maintained a strong grip on power.
- The community prediction for similar questions in the past has often been influenced by immediate political events, suggesting that the prediction could fluctuate based on current developments.

### Consensus Views
- As of now, the community prediction for the question is likely influenced by Khamenei's health and the political unrest in Iran. If the prediction is currently below 6.00%, it may rise as the date approaches, especially if there are significant developments regarding Khamenei's health or political stability.

### Missing Factors
- **International Relations**: The impact of international sanctions and relations with Western countries could also play a role in the internal dynamics of Iran, potentially influencing the community's outlook on Khamenei's leadership.
- **Public Sentiment**: The extent of public support for Khamenei and the regime could shift rapidly, especially in response to economic conditions or political events.

### Conclusion
Given the current information, it is plausible that the community prediction could exceed 6.00% by September 2025, particularly if Khamenei's health continues to decline or if there are significant political developments. However, the resolution will depend on the specific circumstances leading up to that date, including any major events that could sway public opinion and community sentiment. 

In summary, while there are factors that could lead to a prediction above 6.00%, the uncertainty surrounding Khamenei's health and the political climate in Iran makes it difficult to definitively conclude at this stage.

To assess the potential outcome for the New Democratic Party (NDP) in the 2025 Canadian federal election, we need to consider several factors, including recent electoral trends, party dynamics, public opinion, and expert analyses.

### Current Context and Recent Trends
1. **2021 Federal Election Results**: In the 2021 federal election, the NDP won 25 seats, which was a slight increase from the 2019 election where they secured 24 seats. This indicates a relatively stable base for the party, but not significant growth.

2. **Public Opinion and Polling**: As of late 2023, various polls indicate fluctuating support for the NDP, often ranging between 15% to 20% of the popular vote. This is lower than the Liberal Party and Conservative Party, which typically dominate Canadian federal elections. The NDP's support is often concentrated in urban areas and among younger voters.

3. **Party Leadership and Strategy**: Jagmeet Singh has been the leader of the NDP since 2017. His leadership style and policies resonate with certain demographics, but there are concerns about broader appeal. The party's strategy leading up to the 2025 election will be crucial, especially in addressing issues like healthcare, climate change, and economic inequality.

4. **Coalition Dynamics**: The NDP has historically been part of informal agreements with the Liberal Party, such as the confidence-and-supply agreement that has been in place since 2021. The continuation or alteration of such arrangements could impact voter sentiment and the NDP's seat count.

5. **Regional Variations**: The NDP traditionally performs well in British Columbia and parts of Ontario and Quebec. However, their performance can vary significantly by region, and any shifts in voter sentiment in these key areas will be critical.

### Expert Opinions and Consensus Views
- **Political Analysts**: Many analysts suggest that the NDP's ability to increase its seat count in 2025 will depend on its ability to mobilize young voters and address pressing social issues. Some predict a potential increase in seats if the party can effectively differentiate itself from the Liberals and Conservatives.
- **Base Rates**: Historically, the NDP has struggled to break past the 30-seat mark in federal elections, with their best performance being 44 seats in 2011. Given current polling and historical trends, a modest increase or stabilization around 25-30 seats seems plausible.

### Missing Factors
- **Economic Conditions**: The state of the Canadian economy leading up to the election could significantly influence voter behavior. Economic downturns often benefit opposition parties.
- **Emerging Issues**: New issues or crises (e.g., climate events, healthcare crises) could shift public opinion rapidly, impacting the NDP's prospects.
- **Voter Turnout**: The demographics of voter turnout, particularly among younger voters who tend to support the NDP, will be crucial. High turnout in urban centers could favor the NDP.

### Conclusion
Based on the current information, the NDP's seat count in the 2025 federal election is likely to be influenced by a combination of their current polling, regional strengths, and the political landscape as the election date approaches. While a significant increase in seats is uncertain, maintaining or slightly increasing their current count appears to be a reasonable expectation. 

**Resolution Criteria**: The question will resolve based on the number of seats won by NDP candidates as declared on election day, with no consideration for subsequent events. Given the current trends, the NDP is likely to win between 25 to 30 seats, but this is subject to change based on the factors outlined above.

To provide a detailed rundown for the question regarding the "Market Yield on U.S. Treasury Securities at 1-Year Constant Maturity" (DGS1) for the date 2025-09-24, here are the relevant factors and current information:

### Current Context and Trends
1. **Interest Rate Environment**: As of late 2023, the Federal Reserve has been actively managing interest rates in response to inflationary pressures. The current federal funds rate is at a historically high level, which influences yields on Treasury securities. Analysts expect the Fed to maintain a cautious approach, potentially keeping rates elevated into 2025.

2. **Inflation Outlook**: Inflation rates have shown signs of moderation, but core inflation remains a concern. The trajectory of inflation will significantly impact Treasury yields, as investors demand higher yields in times of uncertainty regarding inflation.

3. **Economic Indicators**: Key economic indicators such as GDP growth, unemployment rates, and consumer spending will influence investor sentiment and, consequently, Treasury yields. A strong economy may lead to higher yields, while signs of recession could push yields lower.

4. **Market Sentiment**: Investor sentiment towards risk assets versus safe-haven assets like Treasuries can affect yields. If market volatility increases, demand for Treasuries may rise, leading to lower yields.

### Expert Opinions
- **Economists and Analysts**: Many economists predict that yields on short-term Treasuries, including the 1-year yield, will remain relatively stable but could see upward pressure if the Fed continues to signal a hawkish stance. Some analysts suggest that yields may peak in 2024 before stabilizing or declining in 2025, depending on economic conditions.

### Base Rates and Historical Context
- **Historical Yields**: Historically, the 1-year Treasury yield has fluctuated significantly based on economic conditions. Reviewing past data can provide insights into potential future movements. For instance, yields have been higher during periods of economic expansion and lower during recessions.

### Missing Factors
- **Geopolitical Events**: Unforeseen geopolitical events can impact market yields. For example, conflicts or significant policy changes can lead to increased volatility in financial markets.
- **Fiscal Policy Changes**: Any major changes in fiscal policy, such as significant government spending or tax reforms, could also influence Treasury yields.

### Bayesian Updating
- As new data becomes available, particularly regarding inflation and economic growth, it will be essential to adjust expectations for the 1-year Treasury yield. Monitoring upcoming economic reports and Fed announcements will be crucial for refining forecasts.

### Fermi-Style Breakdown
- **Factors Influencing Yield**: 
  - Current Federal Reserve policy (high likelihood of maintaining rates)
  - Inflation trends (moderating but uncertain)
  - Economic growth indicators (mixed signals)
  - Market sentiment (risk aversion could lead to lower yields)

### Conclusion
As of now, the outcome of the question regarding the value of the 1-year Treasury yield on 2025-09-24 cannot be definitively predicted due to the dynamic nature of economic conditions and market sentiment. However, based on current trends and expert opinions, it is likely that the yield will be influenced by the Federal Reserve's actions, inflation rates, and overall economic performance leading up to that date.

### Resolution Criteria
- The question will resolve based on the data published on the FRED API for the series DGS1. It is essential to monitor the API for updates, particularly as the date approaches, to ensure that the necessary data point is available for resolution. If no data point is found within the specified time frame, the question will be annulled.

To assess whether Pedro Sánchez will still be president of Spain at the end of 2025, we need to consider several factors, including the current political landscape, upcoming elections, Sánchez's party dynamics, and potential challenges he may face.

### Current Political Context
1. **Sánchez's Tenure**: Pedro Sánchez has been the Prime Minister of Spain since June 2018, leading the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE). His government is currently a coalition with the left-wing party Unidas Podemos.

2. **Recent Elections**: Spain held general elections in July 2023, where Sánchez's PSOE won the most seats but did not secure an outright majority. This led to a coalition government with the leftist party Sumar. The coalition dynamics are crucial, as any significant rift could jeopardize his position.

3. **Political Stability**: The coalition government has faced challenges, including economic issues, regional tensions (especially in Catalonia), and public dissatisfaction over rising living costs. These factors could influence Sánchez's ability to maintain his position.

### Upcoming Events
1. **Local and Regional Elections**: Spain will have local and regional elections in May 2023, which could impact Sánchez's political capital and the PSOE's standing. Poor performance could weaken his position and lead to calls for a leadership change.

2. **General Elections**: The next general elections are expected to occur in late 2025. If Sánchez's coalition does not perform well in the lead-up to these elections, it could lead to a loss of support within his party or from coalition partners.

### Expert Opinions and Consensus Views
1. **Political Analysts**: Many analysts suggest that Sánchez's ability to remain in power will depend on his coalition's stability and his handling of economic issues. If the economy improves, he may have a better chance of retaining his position.

2. **Public Sentiment**: Polls indicate fluctuating public support for Sánchez and the PSOE, with rising discontent over economic conditions. If this trend continues, it could lead to a significant challenge in the next elections.

### Missing Factors
1. **Potential Challenges**: The rise of opposition parties, particularly the conservative Popular Party (PP) and the far-right Vox party, could pose a significant threat to Sánchez's government. Any shifts in voter sentiment could dramatically alter the political landscape.

2. **Coalition Dynamics**: The stability of the coalition with Unidas Podemos is crucial. Any significant disagreements or policy failures could lead to a breakdown, forcing Sánchez to either resign or face a no-confidence vote.

### Conclusion
Based on the current information, the outcome of whether Pedro Sánchez will still be president at the end of 2025 is uncertain. While he holds the position now, the political landscape is volatile, and several factors could lead to a change in leadership before the end of 2025. Therefore, the question is likely to resolve as **No** if significant political shifts occur, particularly around the time of the next general elections. However, if Sánchez can navigate these challenges effectively, he may remain in office. 

In summary, the situation is fluid, and ongoing developments will be critical in determining the final outcome.

To provide a comprehensive overview regarding the "ICE BofA AA US Corporate Index Effective Yield" for the date 2025-09-25, we will focus on the following key areas: current trends in corporate bond yields, expert opinions, and potential influences that could affect the yield by that date.

### Current Trends in Corporate Bond Yields
1. **Current Yield Levels**: As of late 2023, the ICE BofA AA US Corporate Index Effective Yield has been fluctuating due to various economic factors, including interest rate changes by the Federal Reserve, inflation rates, and overall market sentiment towards corporate debt.
2. **Interest Rate Environment**: The Federal Reserve's monetary policy, particularly regarding interest rates, plays a crucial role in determining corporate bond yields. If rates remain high or increase further, yields on corporate bonds are likely to rise as well.
3. **Economic Indicators**: Key indicators such as GDP growth, unemployment rates, and inflation will influence investor confidence and demand for corporate bonds, thereby affecting yields.

### Expert Opinions
1. **Market Analysts**: Many analysts predict that yields may stabilize or even decrease slightly if inflation rates begin to decline and the Fed signals a pause in rate hikes. However, if economic conditions remain volatile, yields could remain elevated.
2. **Credit Risk Assessment**: Experts also note that the credit quality of corporations will impact yields. A potential increase in defaults or downgrades in credit ratings could lead to higher yields as investors demand a risk premium.

### Base Rates and Consensus Views
1. **Historical Data**: Historically, corporate bond yields have shown a tendency to rise during periods of economic uncertainty and fall during stable growth periods. The average yield for the ICE BofA AA US Corporate Index over the past decade has been around 3-4%.
2. **Current Consensus**: The consensus among economists and market analysts suggests that yields may hover around current levels (approximately 4-5%) through 2025, barring any significant economic shocks.

### Missing Factors/Influences
1. **Geopolitical Events**: Potential geopolitical tensions or crises could lead to increased volatility in the bond markets, impacting yields.
2. **Regulatory Changes**: Changes in financial regulations or tax policies affecting corporate debt could also influence yields.
3. **Technological and Market Innovations**: The rise of new financial instruments or changes in investor behavior (e.g., increased ESG investing) could alter demand dynamics for corporate bonds.

### Bayesian Updating and Fermi-Style Breakdown
- **Fermi Estimate**: If we consider the current yield and the expected economic conditions, a rough estimate for the yield on 2025-09-25 could be derived from current levels adjusted for expected economic changes.
- **Bayesian Updating**: As new data becomes available (e.g., economic reports, Fed announcements), the forecast for the yield can be updated accordingly.

### Conclusion
Based on the current information and trends, the yield on the ICE BofA AA US Corporate Index as of 2025-09-25 is likely to be influenced by a combination of interest rates, economic conditions, and market sentiment. The resolution of the question will depend on the data published on the FRED API, which will reflect the yield as of that date. If the data is updated as expected, the question will resolve to the value found on the API. If no data point is available within the specified timeframe, the question will be annulled. 

In summary, while the current consensus suggests a stable yield environment, ongoing economic developments will be critical in determining the actual yield on the specified date.

### Relevant News and Context

1. **Current Sales Data**: The FDA's 2023 Summary Report indicates that 6,127,991 kg of medically important antimicrobial drugs were sold or distributed for use in food-producing animals in the U.S. This sets the baseline for 2024, where a 0.5% increase would require sales to reach at least 6,158,631 kg.

2. **Trends in Antimicrobial Use**: There has been a growing concern regarding antimicrobial resistance (AMR), leading to increased scrutiny and regulation of antimicrobial use in livestock. The FDA has been actively promoting responsible use of these drugs, which could potentially limit sales growth.

3. **Regulatory Environment**: The FDA has implemented various initiatives aimed at reducing the use of medically important antimicrobials in livestock. This includes the Veterinary Feed Directive (VFD) and other measures that encourage veterinarians to prescribe these drugs more judiciously. The impact of these regulations may suppress growth in sales.

4. **Market Dynamics**: The livestock industry is influenced by several factors, including consumer demand for antibiotic-free meat, which may lead producers to reduce their reliance on antimicrobial drugs. However, there is also a countervailing trend where producers may still use these drugs to ensure animal health and productivity, especially in the face of disease outbreaks.

5. **Expert Opinions**: Experts in veterinary medicine and animal husbandry have mixed views. Some believe that the push for reduced antimicrobial use will lead to a decline or stagnation in sales, while others argue that the need for disease management in livestock will sustain or even increase sales.

6. **Economic Factors**: The overall economic environment, including feed prices and livestock market conditions, can influence the use of antimicrobials. If livestock prices are high, producers may be more willing to invest in antimicrobial treatments to protect their investments.

7. **Historical Data**: Looking at historical trends, there has been a gradual decline in the overall use of antimicrobials in livestock over the past few years, primarily due to regulatory pressures and changing consumer preferences. However, fluctuations can occur based on specific disease outbreaks or changes in livestock management practices.

### Missing Factors/Influences

- **Emerging Diseases**: The emergence of new diseases in livestock could lead to increased use of antimicrobials as producers seek to protect their herds.
- **Technological Advances**: Innovations in animal health management, such as vaccines or alternative treatments, could reduce reliance on antimicrobials, impacting sales.
- **Consumer Behavior**: Shifts in consumer preferences towards antibiotic-free products could further influence producers' decisions regarding antimicrobial use.

### Conclusion

Given the current regulatory environment, market dynamics, and historical trends, there is a significant possibility that sales of antimicrobial drugs for livestock may not increase by 0.5% in 2024. The ongoing efforts to reduce antimicrobial use, coupled with changing consumer preferences, suggest that the growth in sales could be limited. However, the potential for disease outbreaks and economic factors could counterbalance these trends.

**Resolution Outlook**: Based on the current information, it appears more likely that the sales will not meet the 0.5% increase threshold, but the final determination will depend on the specific circumstances in 2024 and the eventual data released by the FDA.

To provide a detailed rundown for the question regarding the value of the "30-Year Fixed Rate FHA Mortgage Index" on September 24, 2025, we need to consider several factors, including current trends in mortgage rates, economic indicators, and expert opinions.

### Current Trends and Economic Indicators

1. **Mortgage Rate Trends**: As of late 2023, mortgage rates have been influenced by the Federal Reserve's monetary policy, inflation rates, and overall economic conditions. The 30-Year Fixed Rate FHA Mortgage Index has seen fluctuations, with rates generally trending upward due to the Fed's interest rate hikes aimed at combating inflation.

2. **Inflation and Economic Growth**: Inflation remains a critical factor affecting mortgage rates. If inflation continues to be high, the Fed may maintain or increase interest rates, which could lead to higher mortgage rates. Conversely, if inflation stabilizes or decreases, the Fed might lower rates, potentially leading to lower mortgage rates.

3. **Housing Market Conditions**: The housing market's health, including supply and demand dynamics, also impacts mortgage rates. A strong housing market with high demand may keep rates elevated, while a slowdown could lead to more competitive rates.

### Expert Opinions

- **Economists and Analysts**: Many economists predict that mortgage rates will remain elevated through 2024, with potential stabilization or slight decreases in 2025, depending on economic conditions. However, predictions vary widely, and some analysts caution that unexpected economic shocks could lead to volatility in mortgage rates.

- **Market Sentiment**: The consensus among market analysts suggests that while rates may not drop significantly, they may stabilize around current levels, with some potential for slight decreases if economic conditions improve.

### Base Rates and Historical Context

- **Historical Data**: Looking at historical data for the FHA mortgage index, rates have fluctuated significantly over the past decades. The current average is higher than the historical norm, suggesting that while rates may stabilize, they are unlikely to return to the lows seen in the early 2020s.

### Missing Factors

- **Geopolitical Events**: Unforeseen geopolitical events or economic crises could dramatically impact interest rates and the housing market, which are not easily predictable.

- **Policy Changes**: Changes in government housing policy or significant shifts in the Federal Reserve's approach to interest rates could also influence the index.

### Bayesian Updating and Fermi Breakdown

- **Bayesian Updating**: As new data becomes available, particularly regarding inflation and economic growth, forecasts for the FHA mortgage index should be updated accordingly. If inflation decreases significantly or the Fed signals a shift in policy, rates could drop.

- **Fermi Breakdown**: Estimating the value of the index on the specified date involves considering the current rate, expected trends, and potential economic scenarios. A rough estimate could be made based on current rates and projected trends, but significant uncertainty remains.

### Conclusion

As of now, the outcome of the question regarding the value of the "30-Year Fixed Rate FHA Mortgage Index" on September 24, 2025, cannot be definitively predicted. The resolution will depend on the data published by the FRED API closer to the date. If the index is updated regularly, it is likely that a datapoint will be available within the specified timeframe. However, the potential for significant economic changes means that the exact value remains uncertain. 

In summary, while current trends suggest a stabilization of rates, the actual value on the specified date will depend on various economic factors and the timing of data releases.

To assess whether the community prediction for the Metaculus question "Will any new country attack Israel or Iran between June and December 2025?" will be higher than 9.10% on September 27, 2025, we need to consider several factors, including current geopolitical dynamics, expert opinions, and historical context.

### Current Geopolitical Context
1. **Israel and Iran Relations**: Tensions between Israel and Iran have been escalating, particularly due to Iran's nuclear program and its support for militant groups in the region. Israel has conducted military operations against Iranian interests in Syria and has expressed concerns about Iran's influence in the region.

2. **Regional Dynamics**: The Middle East is characterized by complex alliances and rivalries. Countries like Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Turkey have varying degrees of relations with both Israel and Iran. Recent normalization agreements between Israel and some Arab states (Abraham Accords) may influence regional attitudes towards conflict.

3. **Potential Aggressors**: The likelihood of a new country attacking Israel or Iran would depend on several factors, including domestic political situations in potential aggressor countries, their military capabilities, and their strategic interests. Countries like Hezbollah in Lebanon or proxy groups supported by Iran could also be considered in this context.

### Expert Opinions
- **Geopolitical Analysts**: Many analysts suggest that while tensions are high, outright attacks by new countries are less likely due to the potential for severe retaliation and the current focus on diplomatic solutions.
- **Military Experts**: Some military experts argue that the risk of miscalculation or escalation remains, particularly if there are significant provocations or changes in leadership in the region.

### Historical Context
- **Base Rates**: Historically, direct attacks by new countries on Israel or Iran have been rare, especially in the context of the modern geopolitical landscape. Most conflicts have involved existing regional players rather than new entrants.
- **Recent Conflicts**: The last major conflict involving Israel and a new state actor was decades ago, and recent conflicts have typically involved non-state actors or existing regional powers.

### Community Sentiment and Prediction Trends
- **Metaculus Community Predictions**: As of now, the community prediction for this question may be influenced by recent events, expert analyses, and the overall sentiment regarding the stability of the region. If the community perceives a high likelihood of conflict, predictions may trend upwards.
- **Current Prediction Levels**: It is essential to monitor the current prediction level on Metaculus leading up to the resolution date. If the community sentiment shifts towards a belief in increased conflict, the prediction could rise above 9.10%.

### Missing Factors
- **Unforeseen Events**: Any significant geopolitical event, such as a major military engagement, a change in leadership, or a new alliance, could dramatically alter community predictions.
- **Public Sentiment**: The influence of public opinion and media coverage on the perception of conflict risk could also play a role in shaping community predictions.

### Conclusion
Given the current geopolitical landscape, expert opinions, and historical context, the likelihood of the community prediction exceeding 9.10% on September 27, 2025, will depend heavily on developments in the region leading up to that date. If tensions remain high and the community perceives a credible risk of conflict, it is plausible that the prediction could rise above the threshold. However, if diplomatic efforts succeed or if the situation stabilizes, the prediction may remain below 9.10%. Monitoring the Metaculus community sentiment and any significant geopolitical developments will be crucial in the lead-up to the resolution date.

### Overview of the ICE BofA AAA US Corporate Index Option-Adjusted Spread

The ICE BofA AAA US Corporate Index Option-Adjusted Spread (OAS) is a measure of the yield spread between AAA-rated corporate bonds and risk-free government securities, adjusted for the value of embedded options. It serves as an important indicator of credit risk and market sentiment regarding corporate debt.

### Current Context and Relevant News

1. **Market Conditions**: As of late 2023, the corporate bond market has been influenced by rising interest rates, inflation concerns, and economic uncertainty. The Federal Reserve's monetary policy decisions, particularly regarding interest rates, have a significant impact on bond spreads.

2. **Recent Trends**: The OAS has been fluctuating due to changing economic indicators, including inflation rates, employment data, and consumer confidence. As of the latest data, the OAS has shown a slight widening, indicating increased risk perception among investors.

3. **Expert Opinions**: Analysts suggest that the OAS may continue to widen if economic conditions remain uncertain or if the Fed continues to raise interest rates. Conversely, if inflation stabilizes and economic growth resumes, spreads could tighten.

4. **Base Rates and Historical Context**: Historically, the OAS for AAA-rated corporate bonds has averaged around 1-2% over the risk-free rate. Current spreads are higher than historical averages, reflecting increased risk aversion in the market.

5. **Consensus Views**: Market consensus indicates that the OAS may remain elevated through 2024, with potential for gradual tightening if economic conditions improve. However, significant risks remain, including geopolitical tensions and potential recessions.

### Missing Factors/Influences

- **Geopolitical Risks**: Ongoing geopolitical tensions could impact investor sentiment and lead to further widening of spreads.
- **Economic Data Releases**: Upcoming economic data releases (e.g., GDP growth, inflation reports) could significantly influence the OAS.
- **Corporate Earnings**: The performance of corporate earnings in 2024 could also affect credit spreads, as stronger earnings may lead to tighter spreads.

### Bayesian Updating and Fermi-Style Breakdown

- **Current OAS Value**: As of the latest data, the OAS is approximately 1.5% (hypothetical value for context).
- **Expected Changes**: If economic indicators improve, a potential decrease of 0.1-0.3% in the OAS could be expected by September 2025. Conversely, if conditions worsen, an increase of 0.2-0.5% could occur.

### Resolution Criteria

- The question will resolve based on the value found on the FRED API for the series BAMLC0A1CAAA on the specified date (2025-09-23).
- The series is updated daily, so a matching datapoint must be found within one day prior to the resolution date.

### Conclusion

Given the current trends and expert opinions, the OAS is likely to remain volatile leading up to September 2025. The resolution of the question hinges on the availability of the data point on the specified date. If the data point is published and falls within the specified criteria, the question will resolve based on that value. If no data point is found after two weeks of checking, the question will be annulled.

To assess whether the community prediction for the Metaculus question "Will an attempt be made to fire Jerome Powell before the end of his term?" will be higher than 25.00% on September 23, 2025, we need to consider several factors, including current events, expert opinions, and historical context.

### Current Context
1. **Jerome Powell's Position**: Jerome Powell has been serving as the Chair of the Federal Reserve since February 2018. His term is set to end in February 2026. As of now, he has faced criticism from various political figures, particularly regarding interest rate policies and inflation management.

2. **Political Climate**: The political landscape in the U.S. is highly polarized. The potential for attempts to remove Powell could increase if economic conditions worsen or if there is significant political pressure from either party. Recent discussions around the Fed's role in managing inflation and economic growth could influence sentiments toward Powell.

3. **Historical Precedents**: Historically, attempts to remove Federal Reserve Chairs are rare. The last significant attempt was against Alan Greenspan, which did not succeed. This historical context suggests that while there may be vocal criticism, actual attempts to remove a sitting Fed Chair are uncommon.

### Expert Opinions
- **Economists and Political Analysts**: Many experts believe that while there may be calls for Powell's removal, the institutional stability of the Federal Reserve and the importance of maintaining a non-political central bank will likely deter serious attempts. Analysts suggest that any significant economic downturn could change this dynamic, but as of now, the consensus leans towards Powell remaining in his position.

### Community Sentiment on Metaculus
- **Current Prediction Trends**: As of now, the community prediction on Metaculus for this question is likely below 25%, reflecting a general belief that while there may be discussions about Powell's performance, the likelihood of a serious attempt to remove him is low. However, this could change as we approach the resolution date, especially if economic conditions shift dramatically.

### Missing Factors
- **Economic Conditions**: Future economic indicators, such as inflation rates, unemployment, and GDP growth, will play a crucial role in shaping public and political sentiment towards Powell. A significant downturn could lead to increased calls for his removal.
- **Political Developments**: Changes in the political landscape, such as the outcome of the 2024 presidential election, could also influence the likelihood of attempts to fire Powell.

### Conclusion
Based on the current information, it appears that the community prediction is likely to remain below 25.00% unless there are significant changes in economic conditions or political dynamics leading up to the resolution date. Therefore, as of now, the question would likely resolve to 'No' unless unforeseen circumstances arise that could shift community sentiment dramatically. 

### Recommendation for Monitoring
- Keep an eye on economic indicators and political developments leading up to September 2025.
- Monitor changes in the Metaculus community predictions as new information becomes available.

To assess the likelihood of the Bournemouth versus Newcastle match on September 21 resulting in neither team winning, we need to consider several factors, including team performance, historical matchups, expert opinions, and any potential influences that could affect the outcome.

### Current Team Form and Performance
1. **Bournemouth**: As of the latest updates, Bournemouth has had a mixed start to the season, with some draws and losses. Their defensive record has been a concern, which could lead to high-scoring games or draws.
   
2. **Newcastle**: Newcastle has shown stronger form, with a solid attacking lineup and a good defensive record. However, they have also had matches that ended in draws, indicating they are not invulnerable.

### Historical Matchup
- In their previous encounters, Bournemouth and Newcastle have had a mix of results, including draws. This historical context suggests that a draw is a plausible outcome, especially if both teams are evenly matched on the day.

### Expert Opinions
- Analysts and sports commentators have noted that both teams have the potential to score, but also the tendency to settle for draws, especially in tightly contested matches. The consensus seems to lean towards a competitive match that could easily end in a stalemate.

### Base Rates and Consensus Views
- In the Premier League, the average percentage of matches that end in a draw is around 25-30%. Given the current form of both teams, this aligns with the possibility of a draw being a realistic outcome.

### Missing Factors
- **Injuries**: Key player injuries or suspensions could significantly impact the match outcome. If either team is missing crucial players, it could lead to a more defensive approach, increasing the likelihood of a draw.
- **Matchday Conditions**: Weather conditions, pitch quality, and other external factors could also influence the match dynamics, potentially leading to a lower-scoring game.

### Conclusion
Based on the current information, the likelihood of the match ending in a draw (resulting in neither team winning) appears plausible, given the teams' forms, historical matchups, and expert opinions. However, the final outcome will depend on various dynamic factors leading up to and during the match.

**Resolution Criteria**: If the match ends in a draw, the answer will be 'Yes'. If one team wins, the answer will be 'No'. If the match is delayed or canceled, the question remains unsettled until it is played or confirmed as canceled.

In summary, while there is a reasonable chance of a draw, the final outcome remains uncertain until the match is played.

To assess whether the community prediction for the Metaculus question regarding South Africa's removal from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) grey list will be higher than 88.00% on September 27, 2025, we need to consider several factors, including recent developments, expert opinions, and the broader context of South Africa's financial compliance.

### Current Context and Developments

1. **FATF Grey List Status**: South Africa was placed on the FATF grey list in October 2021 due to concerns about its anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CTF) measures. The country has since been working on an action plan to address these deficiencies.

2. **Progress Reports**: The FATF has been monitoring South Africa's progress. In June 2023, the FATF acknowledged some improvements but noted that significant work remained. The next plenary meeting, where South Africa's status will be reviewed, is scheduled for October 2025.

3. **Government Initiatives**: The South African government has implemented various reforms aimed at strengthening its financial regulatory framework. This includes enhancing the capacity of the Financial Intelligence Centre (FIC) and increasing collaboration with international partners.

4. **Expert Opinions**: Financial experts and analysts have mixed views. Some believe that if South Africa continues its current trajectory of reform, it could be removed from the grey list by the fall 2025 meeting. Others caution that the pace of reform may not be sufficient to meet FATF standards by that time.

5. **Public Sentiment and Economic Impact**: The grey listing has had negative implications for South Africa's economy, including increased borrowing costs and reduced foreign investment. There is significant public and political pressure to achieve compliance, which may influence the government's commitment to meeting FATF requirements.

### Consensus Views and Base Rates

- **Base Rates**: Historically, countries that have been grey-listed often take several years to be removed, depending on the extent of their compliance efforts. The average time for removal can vary, but many countries have taken 2-4 years to address FATF concerns adequately.

- **Community Sentiment on Metaculus**: As of now, the community prediction for the Metaculus question is likely influenced by the ongoing developments and the perceived likelihood of South Africa's compliance. If the community perceives a strong commitment from the government and tangible progress, predictions may trend higher.

### Missing Factors and Influences

- **Unforeseen Political Changes**: Changes in government or shifts in political will could significantly impact the pace of reforms. Upcoming elections or political instability could derail progress.

- **Global Economic Conditions**: Broader economic conditions, including global financial stability and the impact of international sanctions or pressures, could also influence South Africa's ability to comply with FATF standards.

- **FATF's Evolving Standards**: The FATF may update its standards or expectations, which could affect South Africa's compliance timeline and the community's perception of its likelihood of removal from the grey list.

### Conclusion

Given the current trajectory of South Africa's reforms, the mixed expert opinions, and the historical context of grey-list removals, the community prediction on Metaculus could be influenced by optimism regarding compliance efforts. However, significant uncertainties remain, particularly regarding political stability and the FATF's evolving expectations.

As of now, it is difficult to definitively predict whether the community prediction will exceed 88.00% on September 27, 2025. The outcome will depend heavily on developments in the lead-up to the FATF meeting and the community's assessment of South Africa's progress.

To provide a detailed rundown for the question regarding the ending value of the ICE BofA US High Yield Option-Adjusted Spread (OAS) for the biweekly period from September 29 to October 10, we will consider the following relevant factors:

### Current Context and Market Conditions
1. **Recent Trends in High Yield Spreads**: As of late September 2023, high yield spreads have been influenced by various macroeconomic factors, including interest rate expectations, inflation data, and overall market sentiment. The ICE BofA US High Yield OAS has shown fluctuations in response to these factors.

2. **Economic Indicators**: Key economic indicators such as the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions, inflation rates, and employment data are critical. The Fed's stance on interest rates, particularly any signals of future hikes or cuts, can significantly impact high yield spreads.

3. **Market Sentiment**: Investor sentiment towards risk assets, including high yield bonds, is crucial. Recent volatility in equity markets and geopolitical tensions may lead to increased risk aversion, potentially widening spreads.

### Expert Opinions and Consensus Views
- **Market Analysts**: Analysts are divided on the outlook for high yield spreads. Some expect spreads to widen due to potential economic slowdowns, while others believe that strong corporate earnings and a resilient labor market may keep spreads stable or even narrow.
- **Base Rates**: Historically, high yield spreads tend to widen during periods of economic uncertainty. The current economic environment, characterized by mixed signals, suggests a cautious approach.

### Missing Factors
- **Geopolitical Events**: Any unexpected geopolitical developments could influence market sentiment and risk appetite, impacting high yield spreads.
- **Corporate Earnings Reports**: Upcoming earnings reports during this period could provide insights into corporate health, affecting investor confidence in high yield bonds.

### Bayesian Updating
- As new data becomes available (e.g., economic reports, Fed announcements), it will be essential to update expectations regarding the OAS. For instance, if inflation data comes in higher than expected, it may lead to a reassessment of the Fed's interest rate path, impacting spreads.

### Fermi-Style Breakdown
- **Current OAS Value**: Check the latest available value on the FRED website.
- **Expected Changes**: Consider potential changes based on economic indicators and market sentiment.
- **Final Value Determination**: The final value will be determined by the last available daily value published by FRED for the specified period.

### Conclusion
The resolution of the question will depend on the specific daily value published by FRED for the last calendar day of the period (October 10). If the market is closed or if there is a delay in data publication, the most recent available value will be used. Therefore, it is crucial to monitor the FRED website closely for updates during this period. 

In summary, the outcome will be determined by the data published on FRED, and the current information suggests a cautious outlook for high yield spreads, influenced by economic conditions and market sentiment.

To provide a detailed rundown for the question regarding the maximum intraday value of the VIX from September 29 to October 10, 2025, we need to consider several factors that could influence the VIX during this period. The VIX, often referred to as the "fear index," measures market volatility and is influenced by various economic, political, and market conditions.

### Relevant News and Factors

1. **Market Conditions Leading Up to Q3 2025**:
   - **Economic Indicators**: As of late 2023, the U.S. economy is experiencing fluctuations due to inflation, interest rate adjustments by the Federal Reserve, and geopolitical tensions. These factors could lead to increased market volatility, which would likely raise the VIX.
   - **Earnings Season**: The third quarter typically includes earnings reports from major companies. Positive or negative surprises can lead to significant market movements, impacting the VIX.

2. **Geopolitical Events**:
   - Ongoing geopolitical tensions (e.g., conflicts, trade disputes) can create uncertainty in the markets, leading to spikes in the VIX. Monitoring developments in international relations and their potential impact on the U.S. economy will be crucial.

3. **Market Sentiment**:
   - Investor sentiment can shift rapidly based on news cycles, economic data releases, and other market-moving events. Sentiment analysis from financial news outlets and social media could provide insights into potential volatility.

4. **Historical Trends**:
   - Analyzing historical VIX data during similar periods (e.g., late September to early October in previous years) can provide a baseline for expectations. Historically, the VIX tends to rise during periods of market uncertainty, such as around earnings seasons or significant economic announcements.

5. **Expert Opinions**:
   - Financial analysts and economists may provide forecasts or insights regarding expected market volatility. Gathering opinions from reputable sources can help gauge the consensus on potential VIX movements.

### Missing Factors/Influences
- **Unexpected Events**: Natural disasters, political upheaval, or sudden economic crises can lead to unpredicted spikes in volatility.
- **Market Structure Changes**: Changes in trading regulations, the introduction of new financial products, or shifts in market participants (e.g., increased retail trading) could alter the dynamics of the VIX.

### Bayesian Updating
- As new information becomes available leading up to the specified period, it will be essential to update expectations based on the latest economic data, market trends, and geopolitical developments.

### Conclusion
Given the current information and the factors outlined, the maximum intraday value of the VIX during the specified period will depend heavily on the market conditions leading up to and during that time. While it is impossible to predict with certainty, the potential for increased volatility exists due to economic uncertainties and geopolitical tensions. 

**Resolution Criteria**: The question will resolve based on the highest intraday VIX value recorded during the specified trading days. If the market is closed on any of those days, only the available trading days will be considered. 

In summary, while we cannot definitively state whether the VIX will reach a specific value, the conditions suggest a likelihood of increased volatility, which could lead to a higher maximum intraday VIX during the specified period.

To analyze the potential price returns of Gold Futures (GC) versus S&P 500 Futures (ES) for the biweekly period of September 29 to October 10, 2025, we need to consider several factors that could influence the performance of these assets during that time frame.

### Current Market Context (as of October 2023)

1. **Economic Indicators**:
   - **Inflation and Interest Rates**: As of late 2023, inflation rates have been a significant concern, with central banks, including the Federal Reserve, maintaining a hawkish stance on interest rates. Higher interest rates typically strengthen the U.S. dollar, which can negatively impact gold prices, as gold is often inversely correlated with the dollar.
   - **Economic Growth**: Economic forecasts suggest a potential slowdown in growth, which could lead to increased demand for gold as a safe-haven asset. Conversely, a strong equity market could favor S&P 500 performance.

2. **Gold Market Dynamics**:
   - **Demand and Supply**: Gold demand has been supported by central bank purchases and jewelry demand, particularly in Asia. However, if interest rates remain high, the opportunity cost of holding gold (which does not yield interest) could weigh on its price.
   - **Geopolitical Factors**: Ongoing geopolitical tensions can drive investors towards gold as a hedge against uncertainty.

3. **Equity Market Dynamics**:
   - **S&P 500 Performance**: The S&P 500 has shown resilience, with strong corporate earnings and a recovering labor market. If this trend continues, it could lead to further gains in the index, potentially outpacing gold returns.
   - **Sector Performance**: The performance of technology and consumer discretionary sectors, which are heavily weighted in the S&P 500, will be crucial. If these sectors perform well, it could enhance the overall index return.

### Expert Opinions and Consensus Views
- **Analysts' Forecasts**: Many analysts are divided on the outlook for gold and equities. Some predict that if inflation persists, gold could see a resurgence, while others believe that equities will continue to outperform due to strong fundamentals.
- **Base Rates**: Historically, during periods of economic uncertainty, gold tends to perform well. However, in bull markets, equities often outperform gold significantly.

### Missing Factors
- **Market Sentiment**: Investor sentiment can shift rapidly based on news and economic data releases. Monitoring sentiment indicators leading up to the period in question will be crucial.
- **Unexpected Events**: Any unforeseen geopolitical events or economic shocks could dramatically alter the landscape for both gold and equities.

### Conclusion
As of now, it is challenging to predict definitively whether Gold Futures will outperform S&P 500 Futures in the specified biweekly period. The outcome will depend heavily on economic conditions, interest rates, and market sentiment leading up to that time. 

To resolve the question accurately, we will need to gather the closing prices for both Gold Futures and S&P 500 Futures on September 29 and October 10, 2025, respectively, and calculate the returns based on the provided formula. 

In summary, the resolution of the question will hinge on the performance of both asset classes during that specific period, influenced by the broader economic context and market dynamics.

To analyze the potential price returns of Crude Oil Futures (CL) compared to S&P 500 Futures (ES) for the biweekly period of September 29 to October 10, 2025, we need to consider several factors that could influence the performance of both asset classes during this timeframe.

### Current Context and Relevant News

1. **Crude Oil Market Dynamics**:
   - **Supply and Demand**: As of late 2023, the oil market has been influenced by OPEC+ production cuts aimed at stabilizing prices amid fluctuating global demand. Any continuation or adjustment of these cuts could significantly impact crude oil prices.
   - **Geopolitical Factors**: Tensions in oil-producing regions (e.g., the Middle East) can lead to price volatility. Monitoring developments in these areas is crucial as they can affect supply chains and market sentiment.
   - **Economic Indicators**: Global economic recovery post-pandemic, inflation rates, and energy transition policies are also key factors. A strong economic outlook typically boosts oil demand, while recession fears could dampen it.

2. **S&P 500 Market Dynamics**:
   - **Economic Performance**: The S&P 500 is influenced by broader economic indicators, including GDP growth, employment rates, and consumer spending. As of late 2023, the U.S. economy has shown resilience, but concerns about inflation and interest rates persist.
   - **Corporate Earnings**: Earnings reports from major companies in the index will be critical during this period. Strong earnings can drive the index higher, while disappointing results may lead to declines.
   - **Monetary Policy**: The Federal Reserve's stance on interest rates will also play a significant role. If rates remain high, it could negatively impact stock valuations.

### Expert Opinions and Consensus Views

- **Analysts' Forecasts**: Many analysts are cautiously optimistic about oil prices, projecting moderate increases due to ongoing supply constraints. However, they also warn of potential downturns if global demand falters.
- **Stock Market Sentiment**: The consensus among market analysts suggests that the S&P 500 may experience volatility due to mixed economic signals, but overall growth is expected to continue, albeit at a slower pace.

### Missing Factors and Considerations

- **Seasonal Trends**: Historically, oil prices can be influenced by seasonal demand patterns, particularly in the fall as refineries prepare for winter. This could favor crude oil returns.
- **Technological Advances**: Innovations in energy production and consumption (e.g., renewable energy) could impact both markets differently, potentially favoring S&P 500 companies that are adapting to these changes.
- **Market Sentiment**: Investor sentiment can shift rapidly based on news cycles, which may not be fully captured in current forecasts.

### Bayesian Updating and Fermi-Style Breakdown

- **Fermi Breakdown**: Estimating potential returns could involve breaking down the expected price movements based on historical volatility, current price levels, and anticipated market events. For example, if crude oil is currently priced at $80 per barrel and analysts expect a 5% increase due to supply constraints, while the S&P 500 is at 4,500 with a projected 2% increase based on earnings, the returns could be calculated accordingly.
  
### Conclusion

Given the current information, the outcome of the subquestion regarding the difference in total price returns between Crude Oil Futures and S&P 500 Futures for the period of September 29 to October 10, 2025, will depend heavily on the interplay of the factors outlined above. 

- **Resolution Criteria**: The subquestion will resolve based on the calculated returns from Yahoo Finance data. If CL returns exceed ES returns, the result will be positive; if ES outperforms CL, the result will be negative.

In summary, while there are positive indicators for crude oil due to supply constraints, the S&P 500's performance will hinge on broader economic conditions and corporate earnings. Monitoring these developments will be crucial as the date approaches.

5. **Historical Performance**: Sunderland's historical performance against the specific opponent they will face on that date can provide insights. If they have a strong record against that team, it may boost their chances of winning.

### Expert Opinions and Consensus Views
- **Football Analysts**: Analysts often emphasize the importance of squad depth and form leading into the match. They may also highlight the unpredictability of football, especially in a league as competitive as the Premier League.
- **Betting Odds**: Monitoring betting markets closer to the date can provide insights into public sentiment and expert predictions regarding Sunderland's chances of winning.

### Missing Factors
- **Injuries and Suspensions**: The status of key players as the match date approaches will be crucial. Late injuries or suspensions can drastically alter the team's chances.
- **Matchday Conditions**: Weather conditions, home vs. away status, and fan support can also influence the outcome but are often overlooked in early assessments.

### Conclusion
As of now, it is impossible to definitively predict the outcome of the match on September 21, 2025. The resolution of the question hinges on numerous dynamic factors that will evolve over the next two years. Therefore, the answer remains uncertain until closer to the date, when more information about Sunderland's form, squad, and opposition is available.

To assess whether Alina Habba will still be the U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey on December 31, 2025, we need to consider several factors, including her current position, potential political changes, and historical trends regarding U.S. Attorneys.

### Current Position
- **Alina Habba's Appointment**: Alina Habba was appointed as the U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey in 2021. As of now, she is serving in this role.
- **Tenure**: U.S. Attorneys typically serve at the pleasure of the President, which means they can be replaced at any time. However, they often remain in their positions for several years unless there is a change in administration or significant political pressure.

### Political Context
- **Biden Administration**: Habba was appointed during the Biden administration, and her continued tenure may depend on the political landscape leading up to 2025. If the Biden administration remains in power, she may have a better chance of staying in her position.
- **Potential Changes**: If there is a change in administration (e.g., a Republican president elected in 2024), it is likely that many U.S. Attorneys, including Habba, could be replaced. Historical precedent shows that incoming administrations often appoint their own U.S. Attorneys.

### Expert Opinions and Consensus
- **Legal Experts**: Legal analysts suggest that U.S. Attorneys are often replaced when there is a shift in political power. However, if Habba maintains a good relationship with the current administration and continues to perform well, she may be retained.
- **Base Rates**: Historically, U.S. Attorneys have served an average of 3-4 years, but this can vary widely based on political circumstances. The average tenure has been shorter in recent years due to increased political polarization.

### Missing Factors
- **Public and Political Support**: Habba's ability to remain in her position may depend on her performance and public perception. Any controversies or high-profile cases she is involved in could influence her standing.
- **Future Elections**: The outcome of the 2024 presidential election will be a significant factor. If the Democrats retain the presidency, Habba's chances of remaining in her position increase.

### Conclusion
As of now, Alina Habba is the U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey. However, the political landscape leading up to December 31, 2025, is uncertain. If the Biden administration remains in power, she may continue in her role. Conversely, a change in administration could lead to her replacement. Given these factors, the resolution of the question remains uncertain, and it is essential to monitor political developments and Habba's performance in the coming years. 

**Current Resolution Status**: Uncertain; could resolve as Yes or No depending on political developments and Habba's standing.

### Current Context on Revolut's UK Banking License

1. **Regulatory Background**: Revolut, a financial technology company, has been operating under a restricted banking license in the UK. The Bank of England's Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) is responsible for granting full banking licenses, which would allow Revolut to operate with fewer restrictions and offer a broader range of services.

2. **Recent Developments**: As of now, there have been no announcements from the PRA regarding the granting of a full banking license to Revolut. The company has been actively working towards meeting the regulatory requirements set by the PRA, but specific timelines have not been publicly disclosed.

3. **Expert Opinions**: Financial analysts and industry experts suggest that the timeline for obtaining a full banking license can be unpredictable, often depending on the company's ability to meet regulatory standards and the PRA's assessment process. Some experts believe that the PRA is cautious in its approach, especially given the recent scrutiny of fintech companies.

4. **Base Rates and Historical Context**: Historically, the process for fintech companies to obtain full banking licenses in the UK has taken several years. For example, Monzo and Starling Bank, two of Revolut's competitors, took multiple years to transition from restricted to full licenses. This suggests that a timeline extending into 2025 is plausible.

5. **Consensus Views**: The consensus among financial analysts is that while Revolut is making progress, the likelihood of receiving a full banking license before the end of 2025 is uncertain. Many believe that the PRA will take its time to ensure that all regulatory requirements are met, especially in light of recent financial stability concerns.

6. **Missing Factors**: Potential influences that could affect the timeline include changes in regulatory policies, Revolut's operational adjustments, or shifts in the competitive landscape of fintech in the UK. Additionally, any unforeseen events, such as economic downturns or changes in leadership at the PRA, could impact the timeline.

### Conclusion

Based on the current information, it appears that the likelihood of Revolut receiving a full UK banking license before September 22, 2025, is low. Therefore, the question is likely to resolve with a date after September 21, 2025, if a full license is granted at all. However, if no license is issued by the end of 2025, the question will resolve above the upper bound. 

**Current Resolution Status**: The question is currently leaning towards a potential resolution after September 21, 2025, but remains uncertain. Further developments from the PRA or Revolut will be critical in determining the exact timeline.

### Current State of the ICE BofA US Corporate Index
1. **Index Overview**: The ICE BofA US Corporate Index tracks the performance of U.S. dollar-denominated investment-grade corporate debt publicly issued in the U.S. domestic market. It is a key benchmark for corporate bond performance.

2. **Recent Performance**: As of the latest data available (October 2023), the index has shown fluctuations influenced by interest rate changes, inflation concerns, and economic growth forecasts. The Federal Reserve's monetary policy, particularly regarding interest rates, plays a significant role in corporate bond valuations.

3. **Market Sentiment**: Analysts are currently divided on the outlook for corporate bonds. Some predict a stabilization or slight increase in values as inflation pressures ease, while others caution against potential economic slowdowns that could negatively impact corporate earnings and, consequently, bond values.

### Expert Opinions and Consensus Views
- **Interest Rates**: Experts suggest that if the Federal Reserve continues to raise interest rates, corporate bond prices may decline, leading to lower index values. Conversely, if rates stabilize or decrease, this could support higher index values.

- **Sector-Specific Trends**: Different sectors may perform variably based on economic conditions, and a broad index may mask these nuances.

### Bayesian Updating
- As new data becomes available, particularly regarding interest rates and economic indicators, forecasts for the index value on the specified date should be updated accordingly. 

### Resolution Criteria
- The question will resolve based on the value found on the FRED API for the series BAMLCC0A0CMTRIV as of September 25, 2025. Given that the series is updated daily, the relevant data point must be available within one day prior to the resolution date.

To provide a comprehensive overview regarding the CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index (VXVCLS) and its potential value on September 25, 2025, we will consider several relevant factors, including current trends, expert opinions, and the nature of the index itself.

### Current Context and Trends
1. **Understanding VXVCLS**: The CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index measures the market's expectation of future volatility based on S&P 500 index options. It reflects investor sentiment regarding market stability or instability over the next three months.

2. **Recent Market Volatility**: As of late 2023, the financial markets have experienced fluctuations due to various factors, including inflation rates, interest rate changes by the Federal Reserve, geopolitical tensions, and economic recovery post-pandemic. These factors contribute to the volatility reflected in the VXVCLS.

3. **Historical Data**: Historical trends in the VXVCLS can provide insights into its potential future values. Typically, during periods of economic uncertainty or market downturns, the index tends to rise, while it falls during stable or bullish market conditions.

### Expert Opinions
- **Market Analysts**: Many analysts predict that volatility may remain elevated in the near term due to ongoing economic uncertainties, including potential recessions, inflationary pressures, and geopolitical risks. However, some experts believe that as the economy stabilizes, volatility may decrease, leading to lower values for the VXVCLS.
  
- **Consensus Views**: The consensus among financial analysts suggests that while short-term volatility may be high, a longer-term view (like that extending to 2025) could see a normalization of volatility levels, assuming no major economic shocks occur.

### Base Rates and Missing Factors
- **Base Rates**: Historically, the VXVCLS has shown a tendency to revert to mean levels over time. The average value over the past few years can serve as a baseline for expectations.
  
- **Missing Factors**: Potential influences that could affect the VXVCLS by 2025 include:

### Current Context and Trends
1. **Recent Trends in the U.S. Dollar**: The U.S. dollar has experienced fluctuations due to various factors, including interest rate changes by the Federal Reserve, inflation rates, and global economic conditions. As of late 2023, the dollar has shown strength against several currencies, but there are concerns about potential weakening due to economic policies and geopolitical tensions.

2. **Federal Reserve Policy**: The Federal Reserve's monetary policy significantly impacts the value of the U.S. dollar. If the Fed continues to raise interest rates to combat inflation, this could strengthen the dollar. Conversely, if the Fed shifts to a more dovish stance, it could lead to a depreciation of the dollar.

3. **Global Economic Conditions**: The performance of the dollar is also influenced by global economic conditions, including the economic recovery in Europe and Asia, trade balances, and geopolitical events. Any significant economic downturns or crises could lead to a flight to safety, bolstering the dollar.

### Expert Opinions
- **Economists and Analysts**: Many economists predict that the dollar may remain strong in the short term due to ongoing interest rate hikes. However, there is a consensus that the dollar's strength may wane as global economic conditions stabilize and other central banks catch up with the Fed's policies.

- **Market Sentiment**: Investor sentiment can also play a crucial role. If investors perceive that the U.S. economy is slowing down or that inflation is under control, they may adjust their positions, impacting the dollar's value.

To analyze the UST 10Y Yield for the biweekly period from September 29 to October 10, we need to consider several factors that could influence the yield during this timeframe. Here’s a detailed rundown of the relevant news and factors:

### Current Economic Context
1. **Federal Reserve Policy**: The Federal Reserve has been maintaining a hawkish stance, with interest rates at elevated levels to combat inflation. Recent comments from Fed officials suggest that rates may remain high for an extended period, which typically supports higher yields on Treasury securities.

2. **Inflation Data**: Recent inflation reports have shown persistent inflationary pressures, which could lead to expectations of further rate hikes or prolonged high rates. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) data leading up to this period will be critical in shaping market expectations.

3. **Economic Growth Indicators**: Economic growth indicators, such as GDP growth rates and employment data, are also influencing yields. Strong economic data could lead to higher yields as investors anticipate continued Fed tightening, while weak data could have the opposite effect.

### Market Sentiment
1. **Investor Behavior**: There has been a trend of investors seeking safety in Treasuries amid global uncertainties, including geopolitical tensions and economic slowdowns in other regions. This could lead to fluctuations in demand for 10Y Treasuries, impacting yields.

2. **Yield Curve Dynamics**: The yield curve has been closely watched, with the 10Y yield often reflecting long-term economic expectations. Any steepening or flattening of the curve could signal changing investor sentiment regarding future economic conditions.

### Recent Trends
1. **Current Yield Levels**: As of late September 2023, the UST 10Y yield has been fluctuating around the 4.25% to 4.50% range. Monitoring the yield leading up to the end of the biweekly period will be essential.

2. **Market Events**: Key economic reports and Fed meetings scheduled during this period could lead to volatility in yields. For example, if the Fed announces any unexpected policy changes or if significant economic data is released, it could impact the yield.

### Expert Opinions
1. **Analysts' Forecasts**: Many analysts expect the 10Y yield to remain elevated, with some projecting it could rise further if inflation remains stubbornly high. However, there are also views that suggest a potential pullback if economic data disappoints.

2. **Consensus Views**: The consensus among economists and market analysts appears to lean towards a stable to slightly increasing yield, given the current economic indicators and Fed policy stance.

### Missing Factors
1. **Global Economic Conditions**: Developments in international markets, such as changes in foreign interest rates or economic crises, could impact U.S. yields but may not be fully accounted for in domestic forecasts.

2. **Market Reactions to Data Releases**: The immediate market reaction to economic data releases can be unpredictable and may not align with longer-term trends.

### Conclusion
Based on the current information, the UST 10Y yield is likely to be influenced by ongoing economic conditions, Fed policy, and market sentiment. The specific ending value for the period from September 29 to October 10 will depend on the yield on the last available day, which is expected to be influenced by the factors outlined above. 

To resolve the question, we will need to monitor the FRED website for the published yield on the final calendar day of the period, which is expected to be October 6, 2023, as the market is closed on October 7 and 8. If the yield is published on that date, it will be used for resolution; if not, the most recent available value will be taken.

To analyze the potential difference in total price returns between Nasdaq-100 Futures (NQ) and S&P 500 Futures (ES) for the biweekly period of September 29 to October 10, 2025, we need to consider several factors, including current market trends, expert opinions, and historical performance.

### Current Market Context (as of October 2023)
1. **Market Trends**: As of now, the tech sector, which heavily influences the Nasdaq-100, has shown resilience and growth, particularly in areas like artificial intelligence and cloud computing. The S&P 500, while also benefiting from tech stocks, has a broader exposure to various sectors, including energy and consumer goods, which may not be performing as strongly.

2. **Economic Indicators**: Key economic indicators such as inflation rates, interest rates, and employment figures will play a significant role in market performance leading up to Q3 2025. Currently, the Federal Reserve's stance on interest rates and inflation control is critical. If rates remain high, it could dampen growth prospects for both indices, but tech stocks may be more sensitive to these changes.

3. **Expert Opinions**: Analysts are generally optimistic about the tech sector's growth potential, with many forecasting continued outperformance of the Nasdaq-100 over the S&P 500. However, some caution against overvaluation in tech stocks, which could lead to corrections.

4. **Historical Performance**: Historically, the Nasdaq-100 has outperformed the S&P 500 during periods of strong tech growth. However, it has also been more volatile. The performance of both indices in the months leading up to the specified period will be crucial for forecasting.

### Missing Factors
- **Geopolitical Events**: Any significant geopolitical developments (e.g., trade tensions, conflicts) could impact market sentiment and performance.
- **Sector Rotation**: Investors may shift their focus from tech to value stocks or other sectors, which could affect the relative performance of NQ and ES.

### Bayesian Updating
As new data becomes available (e.g., economic reports, earnings announcements), it will be essential to update expectations regarding the performance of both indices. For instance, if tech earnings are strong, it may lead to an upward revision of expected returns for NQ relative to ES.

### Fermi-Style Breakdown
1. **Estimate the expected returns for NQ**: Consider the growth rates of major tech companies and the overall market sentiment.
2. **Estimate the expected returns for ES**: Factor in the performance of non-tech sectors and overall economic conditions.
3. **Calculate the difference**: This will provide a rough estimate of how much NQ is expected to outperform ES.

### Conclusion
Given the current trends favoring the tech sector, expert opinions leaning towards continued growth in the Nasdaq-100, and the potential for volatility, it is plausible that the Nasdaq-100 Futures will exceed the S&P 500 Futures in total price returns during the specified biweekly period. However, the outcome will heavily depend on economic conditions, sector performance, and any unforeseen events leading up to that time. 

**Resolution Criteria**: The question will resolve based on the calculated difference in returns (NQ_return - ES_return) for the specified period, using the closing prices from Yahoo Finance. If the S&P 500 outperforms the Nasdaq-100, the resolution will be negative, while a positive difference indicates outperformance by the Nasdaq-100.

To assess the labor force participation rate (LFPR) for individuals aged 16 and older in the U.S. for October 2025, we need to consider several factors, including current trends, demographic shifts, economic conditions, and expert opinions. Here’s a detailed rundown of the relevant information:

### Current Labor Force Participation Rate
As of the latest data (September 2023), the overall LFPR for those aged 16 and older is approximately 62.8%. This figure has seen fluctuations due to various economic conditions, including the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on employment.

### Trends and Projections
1. **Demographic Changes**: The U.S. population is aging, with a significant portion of the workforce moving into retirement age. This trend could lead to a decrease in the LFPR as more individuals exit the labor force. The U.S. Census Bureau projects that by 2030, all baby boomers will be over 65, which could further impact participation rates.

2. **Economic Conditions**: The LFPR is sensitive to economic conditions. A strong economy typically encourages higher participation rates, while recessions can lead to declines. Current economic indicators suggest a mixed outlook, with inflation concerns and potential interest rate hikes affecting consumer confidence and spending.

3. **Post-Pandemic Recovery**: The labor market has been recovering from the pandemic, but challenges remain, such as childcare availability and remote work preferences. These factors can influence individuals' decisions to participate in the labor force.

4. **Policy Impacts**: Government policies, such as changes in minimum wage laws, unemployment benefits, and workforce development programs, can also affect participation rates. The Biden administration has focused on job creation and workforce training, which may positively influence LFPR.

### Expert Opinions
- **Labor Economists**: Many labor economists predict a gradual increase in LFPR as the economy stabilizes, but they also caution that demographic shifts (aging population) will counteract this growth.
- **Federal Reserve**: The Fed's focus on employment and inflation will play a crucial role in shaping labor market conditions. Their policies could either stimulate or dampen participation rates depending on economic performance.

### Base Rates and Historical Context
Historically, the LFPR for those aged 16 and older has been declining since the late 1990s, primarily due to demographic changes. The participation rate for older workers (55+) has been increasing, but this is offset by declines in younger age groups (16-24), particularly during economic downturns.

### Missing Factors
- **Technological Changes**: Automation and AI may displace certain jobs, potentially affecting participation rates, especially among lower-skilled workers.
- **Health Trends**: The long-term health impacts of COVID-19 and other health crises could influence the ability of individuals to participate in the labor force.
- **Cultural Shifts**: Changes in societal attitudes towards work, such as the gig economy and remote work preferences, may also play a role.

### Conclusion
Given the current LFPR of 62.8%, demographic trends indicating an aging population, and mixed economic signals, the LFPR for October 2025 is likely to be influenced by these factors. While there may be some recovery in participation rates due to economic improvements and policy initiatives, the overarching trend of an aging workforce suggests a potential decline or stagnation in the LFPR for those aged 16 and older.

### Resolution Criteria
Based on current information, the question of whether the LFPR for October 2025 will be higher than the current rate (62.8%) remains uncertain. The consensus leans towards a potential decline or stagnation due to demographic shifts, but economic recovery could provide a counterbalance. Therefore, the resolution of this question is currently ambiguous, leaning towards a **No** if considering the long-term demographic trends.

To provide a detailed rundown on the U-3 unemployment rate in the United States for October 2025, we need to consider several factors, including current economic indicators, expert opinions, and historical trends. Here’s a concise overview:

### Current Economic Context
1. **Current U-3 Rate**: As of the latest data (September 2023), the U-3 unemployment rate stands at approximately 3.8%. This figure has remained relatively stable over the past year, indicating a tight labor market.

2. **Economic Growth**: The U.S. economy has shown signs of resilience, with GDP growth projected to be moderate. However, concerns about inflation and potential interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve could impact economic activity and employment.

3. **Labor Market Trends**: Job openings remain high, but there are signs of a cooling labor market, with layoffs increasing in certain sectors, particularly in technology and finance. This could lead to a gradual increase in the unemployment rate.

### Expert Opinions
- **Economists' Forecasts**: Many economists predict that the U-3 unemployment rate may rise slightly over the next two years due to potential economic slowdowns and the effects of monetary policy. A common estimate suggests a range of 4.0% to 4.5% for late 2025.
  
- **Labor Market Analysts**: Analysts emphasize that while the labor market is currently strong, external factors such as geopolitical tensions, supply chain disruptions, and domestic policy changes could influence employment levels.

### Historical Trends
- **Base Rates**: Historically, the U-3 unemployment rate has fluctuated between 3.5% and 10% over the past few decades, with a general downward trend since the peak during the COVID-19 pandemic. The average U-3 rate in the years leading up to 2023 was around 4.0% to 4.5%.

### Missing Factors
- **Policy Changes**: Potential changes in fiscal policy, such as infrastructure spending or social programs, could impact job creation and unemployment rates.
  
- **Technological Changes**: The ongoing impact of automation and AI on job markets could lead to structural unemployment in certain sectors, which may not be fully accounted for in current forecasts.

### Bayesian Updating
- As new data becomes available, particularly regarding economic growth, inflation, and labor market conditions, forecasts for the U-3 unemployment rate should be updated accordingly. Monitoring the Federal Reserve's actions and economic indicators will be crucial.

### Conclusion
Based on the current information, the U-3 unemployment rate for October 2025 is likely to be in the range of 4.0% to 4.5%, with a slight upward trend expected due to economic factors. The resolution of the question will depend on the first estimate published by the BLS, which will provide the definitive figure. 

In summary, while the current rate is stable, various economic indicators suggest a potential increase in the U-3 unemployment rate by October 2025.

To assess whether the US Congress will pass the Farm Bill by January 1, 2026, we need to consider several factors, including the current legislative timeline, historical context, expert opinions, and potential influences on the bill's passage.

### Current Legislative Context
1. **Timeline**: The Farm Bill is typically reauthorized every five years. The last Farm Bill was signed into law in December 2018, which means the next iteration is due by the end of 2023. However, Congress often extends the timeline for passing such legislation, especially in an election year.
   
2. **Current Status**: As of now, discussions around the Farm Bill are ongoing, with various stakeholders, including farmers, agricultural organizations, and lawmakers, weighing in on priorities. The House and Senate Agriculture Committees are expected to begin drafting the new bill soon, but no formal text has been published yet.

### Historical Context
1. **Past Performance**: Historically, the Farm Bill has been passed on time, but there have been instances of delays, particularly when there are significant disagreements over funding and policy priorities. The last Farm Bill was delayed due to partisan disagreements, which could be a relevant factor moving forward.

2. **Bipartisan Support**: The Farm Bill generally enjoys bipartisan support, as it affects a wide range of constituents, including farmers, rural communities, and food assistance programs. However, political polarization in Congress could complicate negotiations.

### Expert Opinions
1. **Agricultural Economists**: Experts suggest that the urgency of addressing agricultural issues, especially in light of recent supply chain disruptions and inflation, may push Congress to prioritize the Farm Bill. However, they also caution that contentious issues, such as SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) funding, could lead to protracted negotiations.

2. **Political Analysts**: Analysts indicate that the upcoming 2024 elections may influence the timeline, as lawmakers may be hesitant to take controversial votes close to election day. This could lead to a delay in passing the bill if significant disagreements arise.

### Consensus Views
1. **Current Consensus**: There is a general expectation that Congress will aim to pass the Farm Bill before the end of 2023 to avoid a lapse in funding and programs. However, the potential for delays exists, particularly if negotiations become contentious.

2. **Base Rates**: Historically, Farm Bills have been passed within a year of their due date, but the political climate and external factors (e.g., economic conditions, public opinion) can significantly impact this timeline.

### Missing Factors/Influences
1. **Economic Conditions**: The state of the economy, including inflation and agricultural commodity prices, could influence the urgency and content of the Farm Bill.
   
2. **Political Dynamics**: The balance of power in Congress post-2024 elections could also affect the bill's passage, especially if there is a shift in party control.

### Conclusion
Based on the current information, the question of whether the US Congress will pass the Farm Bill by January 1, 2026, remains uncertain. While there is a strong incentive to pass the bill on time, potential delays due to political disagreements and the upcoming election cycle could impact the timeline. Therefore, the resolution of this question is currently leaning towards **No**, but it is subject to change as the legislative process unfolds. 

Monitoring developments in Congress, particularly the publication of the bill and any reports from reputable news sources, will be crucial for updating this assessment.

To assess whether any of the listed U.S. federal government officials will leave their positions before October 1, 2025, we need to consider several factors, including current political dynamics, historical trends, and any recent news regarding these officials.

### Current Context and Relevant News

1. **Political Landscape**: The U.S. federal government is currently under a Republican administration, which may influence the stability of appointments. However, the political environment can be volatile, especially with the upcoming 2024 presidential election, which could lead to changes in administration and cabinet positions.

2. **Cabinet and Agency Stability**: Historically, cabinet positions can see turnover due to various reasons, including policy disagreements, scandals, or shifts in political priorities. The current cabinet members have been in their roles for varying lengths of time, with some having more stable tenures than others.

3. **Recent Developments**:
   - **Marco Rubio (State)**: As a prominent figure, he may be less likely to leave unless there are significant political shifts.
   - **Scott Bessent (Treasury)**: No recent news indicating instability.
   - **Peter Hegseth (War)**: His position is relatively new, and he may be secure for the time being.
   - **Pamela Bondi (Justice)**: No recent controversies or indications of leaving.
   - **Doug Burgum (Interior)**: No significant news suggesting a departure.
   - **Lori Chavez-DeRemer (Labor)**: No recent news indicating instability.

   - **Kelly Loeffler (SBA)**: No recent news indicating instability.
   - **Russell Vought (OMB)**: No significant news suggesting a departure.
   - **Dorothy Shea (U.N. Ambassador)**: No recent news indicating instability.

5. **Potential for Resignations or Announcements**: The political climate leading up to the 2024 elections may prompt some officials to resign or announce their departure, especially if they wish to pursue other opportunities or if they face pressure from within the administration.

### Expert Opinions and Consensus Views

- **Political Analysts**: Many analysts suggest that cabinet members may remain stable until after the 2024 elections, barring any scandals or significant policy failures.
- **Historical Trends**: Historically, cabinet turnover tends to increase during election years, particularly if the administration is facing challenges.

### Missing Factors

- **Scandals or Controversies**: Any unforeseen scandals could lead to immediate departures.
- **Health Issues**: Personal health issues can also lead to unexpected resignations.
- **Political Pressure**: Changes in political dynamics, such as shifts in public opinion or pressure from party leadership, could influence decisions to leave.

### Conclusion

Based on the current information, there are no immediate indicators that any of the listed officials will leave their positions before October 1, 2025. However, the political landscape is fluid, and changes could occur as the 2024 elections approach. Therefore, the question currently leans towards a **No** resolution, but it remains subject to change based on future developments.

### Current Context and Relevant News

1. **Alassane Ouattara's Political Background**: Alassane Ouattara has been the President of Ivory Coast since 2010 and was re-elected in 2020. His tenure has been marked by economic growth but also political tensions, particularly surrounding the 2020 election, which was boycotted by the opposition.

2. **2025 Presidential Election Dynamics**: The next presidential election is scheduled for October 2025. Ouattara has indicated intentions to run again, but there are questions about his health and the political landscape, including potential challengers from opposition parties.

3. **Public Sentiment and Opposition**: Recent polls and public sentiment indicate a mixed view of Ouattara's presidency. While he has maintained a significant support base, there is notable opposition, particularly from parties that boycotted the last election. The opposition's ability to unify and present a strong candidate will be crucial in determining the election outcome.

4. **Electoral System and Historical Context**: The Ivorian electoral system requires a candidate to secure more than 50% of the vote to win outright in the first round. Historical data from the 2020 election shows Ouattara received approximately 94% of the vote, but this was under contentious circumstances, including a boycott by major opposition parties.

5. **Base Rates and Consensus Views**: Historically, incumbents in Ivory Coast have performed well in elections, but the political climate has changed significantly since the last election. Analysts suggest that while Ouattara has a strong chance of winning, achieving 80% or more may be challenging due to increased opposition activity and potential voter apathy.

6. **Missing Factors**: Key factors that could influence the outcome include:
   - The state of the economy leading up to the election.
   - The health and political viability of Ouattara as a candidate.
   - The ability of opposition parties to mobilize voters and present a credible alternative.
   - Potential international influences or interventions, especially from organizations monitoring the election.

### Conclusion on Resolution Criteria

Based on the current information, the question of whether Alassane Ouattara will win 80% or more of the first round vote in the 2025 presidential election remains uncertain. While he has a strong incumbency advantage, the political landscape is more competitive than in previous elections, and significant opposition could hinder his ability to achieve such a high percentage of the vote.

- **Current Resolution Status**: The question is currently open, with no definitive Yes or No answer. The outcome will depend on the evolving political dynamics leading up to the election, including the strength of opposition candidates and voter turnout. If the election is postponed beyond December 31, 2025, the question will be annulled.

To assess the question of whether the 12-month percentage change in the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) will be lower in November 2025 than it was in November 2024 (2.73258%), we need to consider several factors, including current economic conditions, expert opinions, and potential future trends.

### Current Economic Context
1. **Inflation Trends**: As of late 2023, inflation rates have been a significant concern, with the CPI showing fluctuations. The Federal Reserve has been actively managing interest rates to combat inflation, which has seen some success in stabilizing prices but remains a critical factor in future CPI changes.

2. **Federal Reserve Policy**: The Fed's monetary policy, including interest rate hikes, is aimed at controlling inflation. If the Fed continues to raise rates or maintains a restrictive stance, it could lead to lower inflation rates in the future. However, if economic growth slows significantly, this could also impact consumer prices.

3. **Supply Chain Issues**: Ongoing supply chain disruptions, which have been a factor in inflation, may continue to affect prices. If these issues are resolved, it could lead to a decrease in inflation rates.

4. **Energy Prices**: Energy prices have a significant impact on the CPI. If energy prices stabilize or decrease, this could contribute to a lower CPI percentage change.

### Expert Opinions
- **Economists' Forecasts**: Many economists predict that inflation will moderate over the next couple of years, with some projecting that the CPI will stabilize around the Fed's target of 2%. However, there is uncertainty regarding external factors such as geopolitical events, climate change impacts, and global economic conditions that could influence inflation.

- **Market Sentiment**: Financial markets are currently pricing in expectations of lower inflation in the medium term, but there is a wide range of opinions on how quickly this will occur.

### Base Rates and Historical Context
- Historically, CPI changes can be volatile, but recent trends have shown a gradual decline from the peaks seen in 2021 and 2022. The base rate for CPI changes has varied, but the current rate of 2.73258% is relatively low compared to the highs of over 9% seen in mid-2022.

### Missing Factors
- **Consumer Behavior**: Changes in consumer spending habits, particularly in response to economic conditions and interest rates, could significantly impact inflation.
- **Global Economic Conditions**: Factors such as international trade dynamics, currency fluctuations, and global supply chain recovery could also play a role in future CPI changes.

### Conclusion
Based on the current information, the resolution of the question hinges on the interplay of monetary policy, supply chain recovery, energy prices, and consumer behavior. While there is a consensus that inflation may moderate, the degree to which it will fall below the November 2024 rate of 2.73258% remains uncertain. 

**Current Resolution Status**: The question currently leans towards a **No** resolution, as many indicators suggest that inflation may stabilize around current levels or slightly lower, but not necessarily below 2.73258% by November 2025. However, ongoing developments in economic policy and external factors could influence this outcome significantly.

To assess whether the IBEX 35 will close 2025 higher than it started, we need to consider several factors, including current market conditions, economic indicators, expert opinions, and historical performance.

### Current IBEX 35 Status
- As of October 2023, the IBEX 35 is trading around €9,000. This is significantly below the threshold of €11,595.00 required for a "Yes" resolution.
- The index has shown volatility in recent months, influenced by various economic factors, including inflation rates, interest rates, and geopolitical tensions.

### Economic Indicators
- **Inflation and Interest Rates**: The European Central Bank (ECB) has been raising interest rates to combat inflation, which could impact economic growth and corporate earnings. If inflation remains high, it may lead to further rate hikes, potentially dampening market performance.
- **GDP Growth**: Spain's GDP growth has been relatively strong compared to other Eurozone countries, but forecasts for 2024 and 2025 suggest a slowdown as the effects of monetary policy take hold.
- **Unemployment Rates**: Spain has a high unemployment rate compared to the EU average, which can affect consumer spending and overall economic sentiment.

### Expert Opinions
- **Market Analysts**: Many analysts are cautious about the IBEX 35's prospects, citing potential headwinds from rising interest rates and global economic uncertainty. However, some believe that sectors like tourism and renewable energy could drive growth.
- **Consensus Views**: The consensus among economists is mixed, with some predicting a recovery in 2025 as inflation stabilizes and economic conditions improve, while others remain skeptical about reaching pre-pandemic levels.

### Historical Performance
- Historically, the IBEX 35 has shown resilience but has also faced significant downturns during economic crises. The index's performance in 2025 will likely depend on broader economic recovery trends in Europe and Spain.

### Missing Factors
- **Geopolitical Risks**: Ongoing geopolitical tensions, particularly in Europe, could impact investor sentiment and market performance.
- **Corporate Earnings**: The performance of key companies within the IBEX 35 will significantly influence the index's trajectory. Earnings reports in 2024 and 2025 will be crucial.
- **Global Economic Conditions**: The performance of global markets, particularly the U.S. and China, will also play a role in the IBEX 35's performance.

### Conclusion
Based on the current information, the IBEX 35 is significantly below the required threshold of €11,595.00. While there are potential growth factors, the prevailing economic conditions, expert opinions, and historical performance suggest that reaching this threshold by the end of 2025 is uncertain. 

**Resolution Criteria**: The question will be resolved as **No** if the index does not exceed €11,595.00 by the end of 2025, which appears likely given current trends and forecasts. However, ongoing developments in the economy and market conditions should be monitored for any changes that could influence this outcome.

To assess the potential outcome for the Conservative Party in the 2025 Canadian federal election, we need to consider several factors, including current polling data, historical trends, party dynamics, and expert opinions.

### Current Political Landscape
1. **Polling Data**: As of late 2023, the Conservative Party is generally polling competitively against the Liberal Party, often within a few percentage points. Recent polls indicate that the Conservatives have a slight edge in voter intention, but this can fluctuate significantly as the election date approaches.

2. **Historical Context**: In the 2021 federal election, the Conservatives won 119 seats, a decrease from their previous count. Historically, the party has seen fluctuations in seat counts based on leadership, public sentiment, and key issues at play during the election cycle.

3. **Leadership and Party Dynamics**: The leadership of the Conservative Party is crucial. As of now, Pierre Poilievre leads the party, and his popularity and public perception will significantly influence the party's performance. His ability to connect with voters on key issues such as the economy, healthcare, and public safety will be pivotal.

### Expert Opinions and Consensus Views
- **Political Analysts**: Many analysts suggest that the Conservatives could gain seats in the 2025 election, especially if economic conditions remain challenging for the incumbent government. However, they also caution that the party must address internal divisions and present a cohesive platform to attract undecided voters.
  
- **Base Rates**: Historically, incumbent governments tend to lose seats in their second term, especially if there are economic downturns or significant public dissatisfaction. The Conservatives could benefit from this trend if the Liberals face backlash over their handling of key issues.

### Missing Factors
- **Voter Turnout**: The turnout rate among Conservative supporters versus other parties could significantly impact seat counts. Mobilization efforts will be crucial.
  
- **Regional Variations**: The Conservatives traditionally perform well in Western Canada and parts of Ontario. However, their ability to gain ground in Quebec and urban centers will be critical for increasing their seat count.

- **Emerging Issues**: Unforeseen events or issues (e.g., economic crises, public health concerns) could shift voter sentiment dramatically in the lead-up to the election.

### Bayesian Updating
As new information becomes available (e.g., changes in leadership, major policy announcements, or shifts in public opinion), the forecast for the Conservative Party's seat count should be updated accordingly. 

### Conclusion
Based on the current information, the Conservative Party is positioned to potentially increase its seat count in the 2025 federal election, but this is contingent on various factors, including leadership effectiveness, voter turnout, and the political climate closer to the election date. 

**Resolution Criteria**: The question will resolve based on the number of seats won by Conservative candidates as declared on election day, with no consideration for post-election developments. Given the current trends, it is plausible that the Conservatives could win more than their 2021 seat count, but definitive predictions remain uncertain until closer to the election.

### Overview of the Green Party's Prospects in the 2025 Canadian Federal Election

#### Current Context
As of October 2023, the Green Party of Canada is facing several challenges and opportunities as it prepares for the 2025 federal election. The party's performance in the previous election (2021) saw it win only 2 seats, a significant drop from its peak of 10 seats in 2019. The party's leadership, policy platform, and public perception will play crucial roles in determining its success in the upcoming election.

#### Recent Developments
1. **Leadership and Strategy**: The Green Party has undergone leadership changes, with a new leader expected to be more effective in rallying support. The party's ability to present a cohesive and appealing platform on environmental issues, social justice, and economic policies will be critical.

2. **Public Opinion and Polling**: Recent polls indicate fluctuating support for the Green Party, often hovering around 5-10% nationally. However, regional variations exist, with stronger support in British Columbia and parts of Atlantic Canada. The party's ability to convert this support into seats will depend on strategic campaigning and candidate selection.

3. **Electoral Landscape**: The political landscape in Canada is dynamic, with the Liberal Party, Conservative Party, and New Democratic Party (NDP) being the primary competitors. The Green Party's success may hinge on its ability to attract disillusioned voters from these parties, particularly those concerned about climate change and environmental policies.

4. **Key Issues**: Climate change remains a top priority for many Canadian voters. The Green Party's focus on environmental issues could resonate well, especially if other parties fail to address these concerns adequately. However, economic issues, healthcare, and inflation are also significant factors that could overshadow environmental concerns.

5. **Base Rates and Historical Performance**: Historically, the Green Party has struggled to maintain a consistent presence in the House of Commons. The party's performance in the 2025 election will likely depend on its ability to mobilize its base and attract new voters, particularly younger demographics who prioritize climate action.

#### Expert Opinions
- **Political Analysts**: Many analysts suggest that the Green Party's chances of increasing its seat count in 2025 are contingent on the overall political climate, including voter turnout and the effectiveness of its campaign strategy.
- **Pollsters**: Some polling experts indicate that while the Green Party has a solid base, its ability to gain seats will depend on tactical alliances and the potential for vote-splitting among left-leaning voters.

#### Missing Factors
- **Impact of External Events**: Unforeseen events, such as economic downturns, climate disasters, or significant political scandals, could shift voter priorities and affect the Green Party's performance.
- **Voter Turnout**: The level of engagement among young voters and those concerned about climate issues will be crucial. High turnout in these demographics could benefit the Green Party.

### Conclusion
Based on the current information, the Green Party's prospects for the 2025 federal election remain uncertain. While there is potential for growth, particularly if the party can effectively communicate its platform and mobilize support, historical trends and the competitive political landscape suggest that significant challenges remain. 

**Resolution Criteria**: The question will resolve based on the number of seats won by Green Party candidates in the 2025 election, as declared by credible sources. Given the current trajectory, it is plausible that the Green Party could win between 2 to 5 seats, but this is highly contingent on the factors outlined above.

### Current Context on Greenland Acquisition

1. **Historical Background**: The idea of the U.S. acquiring Greenland gained significant attention in 2019 when then-President Donald Trump expressed interest in purchasing the territory from Denmark. This proposal was met with strong opposition from Denmark and was ultimately dismissed.

2. **Recent Developments**: 
   - As of late 2023, there have been no formal proposals or bills introduced in Congress specifically aimed at acquiring Greenland. The interest in the acquisition appears to have waned since the initial discussions in 2019.
   - The geopolitical context has shifted, with increasing focus on Arctic sovereignty and climate change, but no concrete legislative action has emerged regarding Greenland.

3. **Congressional Dynamics**: 
   - The current composition of Congress (as of late 2023) includes a divided government, with the House of Representatives controlled by Republicans and the Senate by Democrats. This division may complicate the passage of any controversial legislation, including a bill related to the acquisition of Greenland.
   - There is a general lack of bipartisan support for such an acquisition, as many lawmakers view it as impractical or unnecessary.

4. **Expert Opinions**: 
   - Political analysts and foreign policy experts generally agree that the likelihood of Congress voting on a bill to acquire Greenland is low. The consensus is that such a move would require significant diplomatic negotiations with Denmark, which are not currently on the agenda.
   - Experts also note that the U.S. has existing agreements with Denmark regarding Greenland, which may further complicate any attempts to pursue acquisition.

5. **Base Rates and Historical Precedents**: 
   - Historically, territorial acquisitions by the U.S. have been rare and typically involve complex negotiations and treaties. The last significant territorial acquisition was in the 19th century, and there has been no recent precedent for acquiring territory in this manner.
   - The lack of any recent legislative attempts or public support for such a bill suggests a low base rate for this type of action.

6. **Missing Factors**: 
   - While there may be strategic interests in the Arctic region, such as military positioning and resource access, these interests have not translated into legislative action regarding Greenland.
   - The potential for future geopolitical shifts (e.g., increased tensions with Russia or China in the Arctic) could influence discussions, but as of now, there is no indication that this will lead to a vote on acquisition.

### Conclusion

Based on the current information, it is highly unlikely that either chamber of Congress will vote on a bill in furtherance of the acquisition of Greenland before January 1, 2026. There are no active proposals, a lack of bipartisan support, and significant geopolitical and diplomatic hurdles that would need to be addressed. Therefore, the question would resolve as **No**.

### Overview of the 2025 Norwegian Election Context

The next Norwegian parliamentary election is scheduled to take place between November 25, 2023, and September 30, 2025. The current political landscape is shaped by several factors, including recent election results, party dynamics, and public sentiment.

### Current Political Landscape

1. **Recent Election Results**: 
   - In the 2021 parliamentary elections, the Labour Party (Arbeiderpartiet) won 26.3% of the vote, securing 48 seats, while the Conservative Party (Høyre) received 20.4% and 36 seats. The Progress Party (Fremskrittspartiet) and the Socialist Left Party (Sosialistisk Venstreparti) also played significant roles.
   - The Patient Focus party (Pasientfokus) is a relatively new political entity, focusing on healthcare issues, particularly patient rights and healthcare reform.

2. **Current Polling**: 
   - As of late 2023, polling data indicates that Patient Focus is struggling to gain significant traction. Most polls show them below the 4% threshold needed to secure representation in the Storting. The Labour Party and the Conservative Party remain the dominant forces, with the Labour Party currently leading in most polls.

3. **Public Sentiment and Issues**: 
   - Healthcare remains a critical issue for voters, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, established parties like the Labour Party and the Conservative Party have more extensive platforms and historical voter bases.
   - Patient Focus's niche focus may limit its appeal compared to broader platforms offered by larger parties.

### Expert Opinions and Consensus Views

- **Political Analysts**: Many analysts believe that while Patient Focus addresses important issues, its ability to win a significant number of seats is hampered by its limited recognition and the dominance of larger parties. 
- **Base Rates**: Historically, new parties in Norway have struggled to gain a foothold in the Storting unless they can quickly build a broad coalition of support. The success of parties like the Progress Party and the Green Party in previous elections is often attributed to their ability to resonate with a wide range of voters.

### Missing Factors and Influences

- **Coalition Dynamics**: The potential for coalition-building post-election could influence Patient Focus's ability to gain seats. If they can align with other parties on healthcare issues, they may increase their visibility and support.
- **Voter Turnout**: Changes in voter turnout, particularly among younger voters who may be more inclined to support new parties, could impact the overall results.
- **Emerging Issues**: Any significant shifts in public sentiment regarding healthcare or other pressing issues could alter the landscape leading up to the election.

### Conclusion

Based on the current information, it appears unlikely that Patient Focus will win the most seats in the Storting in the 2025 election. The party is currently polling below the threshold needed for representation, and the established parties dominate the political landscape. Therefore, the resolution for the question regarding Patient Focus winning the most seats would likely be **No**. 

### Recommendations for Ongoing Monitoring

- Keep an eye on polling trends as the election date approaches.
- Monitor any significant shifts in public sentiment regarding healthcare and other key issues.
- Watch for potential coalition discussions that could elevate Patient Focus's profile.

To provide a detailed rundown on the S&P/Case-Shiller US National Home Price Index for August 2025, we need to consider several factors that could influence home prices, including current trends, expert opinions, and economic indicators. Here’s a concise overview:

### Current Trends in Home Prices
1. **Recent Data**: As of the latest reports, the S&P/Case-Shiller index has shown fluctuations due to various economic factors, including interest rates, inflation, and housing supply constraints. The index has been experiencing a slight recovery after a period of decline in 2022 and early 2023.
  
2. **Interest Rates**: The Federal Reserve's monetary policy, particularly interest rate hikes, has a significant impact on mortgage rates and, consequently, home prices. As of late 2023, rates have stabilized but remain higher than pre-pandemic levels, which could dampen demand.

3. **Supply and Demand Dynamics**: The housing market is still facing supply shortages, which can support home prices. However, if economic conditions worsen or if interest rates rise further, demand may decrease, leading to potential price corrections.

### Expert Opinions
- **Economists and Analysts**: Many analysts predict a moderate increase in home prices through 2024, with some cautioning that economic uncertainties (e.g., potential recession, inflation) could lead to volatility. The consensus seems to lean towards a stabilization of prices rather than significant growth or decline.
  
- **Real Estate Experts**: Some real estate professionals suggest that while prices may stabilize, regional variations will be significant. Areas with strong job growth and limited housing supply may see price increases, while others may experience stagnation or declines.

### Base Rates and Historical Context
- Historically, the S&P/Case-Shiller index has shown resilience over the long term, but it is also subject to cyclical downturns. The index's performance in the months leading up to August 2025 will be crucial for forecasting.

### Missing Factors
- **Economic Conditions**: Potential economic downturns, changes in consumer confidence, and shifts in employment rates could significantly impact housing demand.
- **Legislative Changes**: Any new housing policies or tax incentives could also influence the market dynamics leading up to August 2025.

### Bayesian Updating
- As new data becomes available, particularly regarding interest rates, inflation, and economic growth, it will be essential to adjust expectations for the S&P/Case-Shiller index. Monitoring these indicators will provide a clearer picture as we approach the target date.

### Conclusion
Given the current information, the S&P/Case-Shiller US National Home Price Index for August 2025 is likely to reflect a stabilization trend, but the exact value will depend on various economic factors leading up to that date. The resolution of this question will depend on the first estimate published on the FRED chart, which will be influenced by the aforementioned factors. 

In summary, while there is no definitive answer at this moment, the consensus suggests a cautious outlook with potential for stabilization in home prices, but significant uncertainties remain.

### Recent Polling Data
- As of late 2023, polls indicate fluctuating support for the major parties. The VVD remains a strong contender, but the PVV has been gaining traction, often polling as the largest party in recent surveys.
- D66 has seen a decline in support, while the Labour Party (PvdA) and Green Left (GL) are also vying for significant seats, especially in urban areas.

### Expert Opinions
- Political analysts suggest that the rise of populist parties like the PVV and FvD could disrupt traditional voting patterns. The VVD's ability to maintain its position may depend on its handling of key issues such as immigration, climate policy, and economic performance.
- Some experts believe that voter fatigue with the current coalition could lead to a shift in support towards opposition parties.

### Historical Trends
- Historically, the VVD has been a dominant force in Dutch politics, but shifts in public sentiment can lead to unexpected outcomes. The last few elections have shown a trend towards fragmentation, with more parties gaining representation.

### Missing Factors
- The impact of upcoming events, such as economic conditions, immigration issues, and international relations, could significantly influence voter sentiment leading up to the election.
- The potential for new parties to emerge or existing parties to form alliances could also alter the dynamics.

### Bayesian Updating
- If the PVV continues to gain support in the polls, it may be positioned to win the most seats. Conversely, if the VVD can consolidate its base and appeal to undecided voters, it may retain its status as the largest party.
- Monitoring shifts in voter sentiment, especially in response to key issues, will be crucial for updating forecasts.

### Conclusion
Based on current information, the leading candidates for winning the most seats in the 2025 Dutch general election are the VVD and PVV, with the potential for other parties to disrupt the outcome. The question will resolve as "Yes" for either VVD or PVV if they secure the most seats, or "Other" if a different party emerges as the largest. The possibility of a tie exists, but the resolution criteria favor the party that gains more seats. 

Continued monitoring of polling data and political developments will be essential for refining predictions as the election date approaches.

### Current Political Landscape in Norway (as of October 2023)

1. **Recent Election Results**: The last parliamentary election in Norway was held in September 2021. The Labour Party (Arbeiderpartiet) won the most seats, followed by the Conservative Party (Høyre) and the Progress Party (Fremskrittspartiet). The Liberal Party (Venstre) secured only 4.6% of the vote, resulting in 3 seats in the Storting, which is a significant decline from previous elections.

2. **Current Polling Data**: As of late 2023, polling indicates that the Liberal Party is struggling to gain traction. Recent polls show them hovering around 3-5% of voter support, which is below the threshold needed to secure a significant number of seats. The Labour Party and the Conservative Party remain the dominant forces, with the Progress Party also showing strong support.

3. **Political Context**: The political environment in Norway is influenced by several factors:
   - **Economic Conditions**: Norway's economy is currently stable, but concerns about inflation and energy prices could impact voter sentiment.
   - **Climate Policies**: The Liberal Party has traditionally focused on environmental issues, but their effectiveness in influencing policy has been questioned, especially as other parties also adopt green policies.
   - **Coalition Dynamics**: The Liberal Party has been part of various coalitions but has struggled to maintain a distinct identity. Their ability to form alliances with other parties could be crucial in the upcoming election.

4. **Expert Opinions**: Political analysts suggest that the Liberal Party's chances of increasing their seat count in the 2025 election are slim unless they can significantly improve their public image and voter appeal. Some experts argue that their focus on niche issues may alienate broader voter bases.

5. **Base Rates and Historical Context**: Historically, smaller parties in Norway have faced challenges in gaining seats when they fall below a certain threshold in polls. The Liberal Party's current standing is reminiscent of past elections where parties with similar support levels failed to make significant gains.

6. **Missing Factors**: 
   - **Emerging Issues**: Any unforeseen political events or emerging issues (e.g., a major scandal, economic crisis, or a significant shift in public opinion) could alter the landscape.
   - **Voter Turnout**: The turnout rate among younger voters, who may be more inclined to support the Liberal Party's policies, could be a critical factor.

### Conclusion

Based on the current information, the Liberal Party is unlikely to win the most seats in the Storting in the 2025 election. Their polling numbers are low, and they face significant competition from larger parties. Unless there is a substantial shift in voter sentiment or a major political event that favors the Liberal Party, the resolution for this subquestion is expected to be **No**.
