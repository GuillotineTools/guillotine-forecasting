Found Research for URL dummy://test.com:
To assess the question of what the age of the oldest human will be as of 2100, we need to consider several factors, including current records, trends in human longevity, and expert opinions.

### Current Record
As of October 2023, the oldest verified person is María Branyas Morera, who was born on March 4, 1907, making her 116 years old. The Guinness World Records recognizes her as the oldest living person. The current record for the oldest verified age is 122 years, held by Jeanne Calment, who lived from 1875 to 1997.

### Trends in Longevity
1. **Advancements in Healthcare**: There have been significant advancements in healthcare, nutrition, and lifestyle that contribute to increased life expectancy. However, the rate of increase in maximum lifespan has not kept pace with average life expectancy improvements.
   
2. **Maximum Lifespan**: The biological limit of human lifespan is still debated. Some researchers argue that while average life expectancy may continue to rise, the maximum lifespan may plateau around 120-125 years. 

3. **Demographic Trends**: The global population is aging, and the number of centenarians is increasing. However, the number of supercentenarians (people aged 110 and older) remains relatively small.

### Expert Opinions
- **Gerontologists**: Many gerontologists suggest that while average life expectancy may continue to rise, the maximum age is likely to remain around 120-125 years for the foreseeable future. 
- **Longevity Researchers**: Some researchers are optimistic about breakthroughs in anti-aging therapies, but these are largely speculative and not yet proven to extend maximum lifespan significantly.

### Consensus Views
- The consensus among experts is that while more people are living longer, the record for the oldest verified human is unlikely to exceed 125 years in the near future. 
- The Guinness World Records has strict criteria for verifying age, which includes documentation and corroboration of birth records.

### Missing Factors
- **Technological Breakthroughs**: Future advancements in biotechnology, genetics, and medicine could potentially extend human lifespan beyond current expectations, but these remain uncertain.
- **Environmental Factors**: Changes in global health crises, climate change, and lifestyle factors could also impact longevity trends.

### Conclusion
Based on current information, the age of the oldest human as of 2100 is likely to be around 120-125 years, with a strong possibility that it will not exceed the current record of 122 years held by Jeanne Calment. Therefore, the resolution of the question will likely be **No**, as it is improbable that the age of the oldest human will surpass 125 years by 2100, based on current trends and expert consensus.

Reasoning from forecaster3 for URL dummy://test.com: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: 75 years (from 2025 to 2100).

(b) The outcome if nothing changed: 122 years (Jeanne Calment’s verified record remains unbroken due to biological limits and no significant medical breakthroughs).

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: 125 years (gradual increase in supercentenarian verification, modest gains from healthcare and lifestyle, but no radical lifespan extension).

(d) The expectations of experts and markets: Most gerontologists and demographers expect maximum lifespan to plateau around 120–125 years. Markets in longevity biotech are optimistic about healthspan, but not necessarily about extending verified maximum age beyond 125 by 2100. No major prediction market currently prices in a high probability of surpassing 130.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: A global catastrophe — such as a nuclear conflict, engineered pandemic, or severe climate collapse — disrupts healthcare systems and scientific progress for decades, leading to reduced life expectancy and no new verified supercentenarians beyond ~115. Verification systems (e.g., Guinness) collapse or become unreliable.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: A convergence of breakthroughs — epigenetic reprogramming, senolytic therapies, AI-designed longevity drugs, and organ regeneration — extends biological limits. A person born in the 2030s reaches 140–160 by 2100, with rigorous documentation satisfying Guinness standards. Global cooperation ensures equitable access and verification.

Given the complexity and uncertainty of biological limits, technological disruption, and global stability, I anchor first on the outside view: verified maximum age has not increased in 27 years since Calment’s death. The base rate of progress is near-zero. Then, I adjust modestly upward for plausible medical advances, but remain cautious due to verification rigor, biological constraints, and the “longevity bottleneck” observed in demographic data.

I also account for “unknown unknowns” — such as unforeseen societal collapse or radical scientific leaps — by widening my confidence intervals significantly. Good forecasting demands humility: even if anti-aging research accelerates, translating lab results into verified, record-breaking human lifespans is extraordinarily difficult.

I break this down with a Fermi-style estimate:
- Probability current biological limit (~122) holds: 40%
- Probability modest extension to 125–130: 40%
- Probability radical extension (>130): 20% (due to compounding breakthroughs)

I weight expert consensus heavily but leave room for black swans. I avoid narrative-driven optimism (“science will solve everything”) and equally avoid pessimism without evidence.

Final distributions reflect:
- 10th percentile: low-end disruption scenario
- 50th percentile: continuation of current trend + modest gain
- 90th percentile: breakthrough scenario with global stability and verification

Reasoning from forecaster5 for URL dummy://test.com: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 75 years (from 2025 to 2100).  
(b) The outcome if nothing changed: If medical advancements stall and the maximum lifespan plateau remains, the oldest human in 2100 would likely match or slightly approach the current record of 122 years.  
(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: The current trend of maximum lifespan plateauing around 120–125 years (with no significant increases since Jeanne Calment in 1997) suggests the oldest human in 2100 would be in the range of 123–125 years.  
(d) The expectations of experts and markets: Most gerontologists and longevity researchers project the maximum lifespan will stay below 125 years by 2100, with a consensus median around 122–124 years, as breakthroughs in anti-aging remain speculative and unproven for extending maximum lifespan.  
(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: A global health crisis (e.g., a novel pathogen targeting the elderly) or widespread collapse of healthcare systems in aging populations (e.g., Japan, Europe) could reduce the number of supercentenarians, keeping the maximum lifespan capped at 120–122 years.  
(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: A breakthrough in anti-aging therapies (e.g., widespread use of senolytics to clear aging cells, or CRISPR-based repair of DNA damage) could extend healthspan and push the maximum lifespan to 130–140 years, with rigorous verification confirming ages beyond the current record.

Reasoning from forecaster6 for URL dummy://test.com:  (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known:
The outcome will be known by the end of the year 2100, which is 75 years from the current date of 2025-09-12.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed:
If nothing changed from the current understanding and trends, the age of the oldest human would likely remain around the current record of 122 years, given that the maximum human lifespan is thought to be around 120-125 years.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued:
If current trends in healthcare, nutrition, and lifestyle continue, we might see a modest increase in the maximum lifespan, potentially reaching or slightly exceeding the current record. However, this trend suggests a plateauing effect around 125 years.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets:
Experts generally agree that while average life expectancy will continue to rise, the maximum lifespan is unlikely to increase significantly beyond the current record of 122 years. The consensus is that breakthroughs in anti-aging would be required to surpass this limit, and such breakthroughs are speculative at this time.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome:
An unexpected global health crisis, such as a novel pandemic more severe than COVID-19, could reverse some of the gains in life expectancy and reduce the maximum lifespan if it disproportionately affects the elderly or if healthcare systems are overwhelmed and unable to provide the necessary care for aging populations.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome:
A breakthrough in anti-aging medicine, such as the development of effective senolytics, gene therapies, or regenerative medicine, could significantly extend the human lifespan. If such treatments were widely available and effective by the mid to late 21st century, they could enable a substantial number of individuals to live beyond the current maximum lifespan, potentially reaching ages of 130 years or more.

Given the wide range of uncertainties and the potential for both unexpected negative and positive events, the forecast should reflect a broad distribution of possible outcomes. The base rate (outside view) suggests that the maximum lifespan is unlikely to change dramatically, but the potential for technological breakthroughs (inside view) could shift this expectation.
