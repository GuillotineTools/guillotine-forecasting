Reasoning from forecaster1 for URL dummy://test.com: 1. Rephrased and Expanded Question:
What will be the age of the oldest human as of the year 2100, according to the official Guinness World Records? The current record is 122 years, and given the potential advancements in medicine and anti-aging research, we must consider the probability distribution of possible ages by 2100.

2. Base Rate/Extreme Outcomes:
The current record for the oldest human is 122 years, set by Jeanne Calment, who lived from 1875 to 1997. Historically, human lifespan records have increased slowly, and breaking such records is rare. The increase in maximum lifespan has not been as rapid as average life expectancy improvements.

3. Reasonable Range Estimate:
A reasonable lower bound would be maintaining the current record of 122 years, as there is no guarantee that the record will be broken. An upper bound could be around 150 years, considering optimistic advancements in anti-aging technology and medicine.

4. Factors Pushing Toward Lower End:
- Lack of significant breakthroughs in anti-aging research.
- Societal or environmental factors negatively impacting health.
- Potential new diseases or pandemics affecting longevity.

5. Factors Pushing Toward Upper End:
- Major breakthroughs in genetics, biotechnology, and personalized medicine.
- Improved global health standards and access to healthcare.
- Enhanced understanding and treatment of age-related diseases.

6. Aggregated Considerations:
Considering historical trends, the slow pace of increase in maximum human lifespan, and potential future advancements, a conservative view would lean towards modest increases. However, accounting for possible breakthroughs, some probability should be assigned to more extreme outcomes.

7. Initial Probability Distribution:
- Percentile 10: 123 years
- Percentile 20: 125 years
- Percentile 40: 128 years
- Percentile 60: 132 years
- Percentile 80: 138 years
- Percentile 90: 145 years

8. Evaluation of Confidence:
The initial distribution might be slightly conservative, especially in the upper percentiles, given the potential for unexpected breakthroughs in medical science. Adjustments should consider a slightly wider distribution to account for the uncertainty in long-term forecasting.

9. Final Probability Distribution:
- Percentile 10: *123*
- Percentile 20: *126*
- Percentile 40: *130*
- Percentile 60: *135*
- Percentile 80: *142*
- Percentile 90: *148*

Reasoning from forecaster4 for URL dummy://test.com: 1. **Rephrased and Expanded Question:**
   What will be the age of the oldest verified human by the year 2100, as officially recorded by the Guinness World Records? The current record is held by Jeanne Calment, who lived to be 122 years old. With ongoing advancements in medical science and anti-aging research, how might these developments influence the potential maximum human lifespan by the end of the 21st century?

2. **Base Rate/Extreme Outcomes:**
   Historically, the record for the oldest human has increased gradually. Jeanne Calment's record of 122 years has stood since 1997. There have been no verified cases surpassing this age, suggesting a natural limit or ceiling to human lifespan under current conditions. However, medical and technological advances could potentially extend this limit.

3. **Estimate a Reasonable Range:**
   - **Lower Bound:** It is reasonable to assume the record could remain around current levels, with no significant breakthroughs. Thus, a lower bound might be around 122-125 years.
   - **Upper Bound:** Considering potential breakthroughs in anti-aging research, an upper bound could be significantly higher, although still within biological feasibility, perhaps around 140-150 years.

4. **Factors for Lower End:**
   - Lack of significant breakthroughs in extending human lifespan.
   - Ethical, social, or economic barriers to widespread adoption of life-extending technologies.
   - Natural biological limits that are difficult to surpass.

5. **Factors for Upper End:**
   - Major breakthroughs in genetics, regenerative medicine, or anti-aging treatments.
   - Improved healthcare and living conditions globally.
   - Increased focus and investment in longevity research leading to practical applications.

6. **Aggregate Considerations:**
   Given historical trends and potential advances, the most likely scenario is a modest increase in the record age, with a smaller probability of significant breakthroughs leading to much higher ages.

7. **Initial Probability Distribution:**
   - Percentile 10: 123 years
   - Percentile 20: 125 years
   - Percentile 40: 130 years
   - Percentile 60: 135 years
   - Percentile 80: 140 years
   - Percentile 90: 145 years

8. **Evaluate Confidence:**
   The initial distribution may be too optimistic about the upper bound, given the historical stagnation in breaking the current record. Adjusting for a more conservative estimate while still considering potential breakthroughs is prudent.

9. **Final Probability Distribution:**
   - Percentile 10: *123*
   - Percentile 20: *125*
   - Percentile 40: *128*
   - Percentile 60: *132*
   - Percentile 80: *137*
   - Percentile 90: *142*

Synthesized reasoning (using openrouter/openai/gpt-4o) for URL dummy://test.com: Both forecasters provide similar reasoning and considerations for estimating the age of the oldest human by 2100, with slight variations in their final probability distributions. They both acknowledge the current record of 122 years and consider potential advancements in medical science and anti-aging research. The primary differences lie in their upper percentile estimates, with Forecaster 1 being slightly more optimistic.

**Agreements:**
- Both forecasters agree on the lower bound starting around the current record of 122 years.
- Both consider the potential for significant advancements in medicine and anti-aging research, though they differ slightly in how they weigh these possibilities.
- Both provide a reasonable range of estimates, acknowledging historical trends and potential breakthroughs.

**Disagreements:**
- Forecaster 1's upper percentiles are slightly higher than Forecaster 2's, reflecting a more optimistic view of future advancements.
- Forecaster 2 is more conservative in the upper percentiles, possibly reflecting a belief in natural biological limits or slower progress in breakthroughs.

**Resolution via Heuristics:**
- **Base Rates:** Historically, increases in maximum lifespan have been slow, suggesting a conservative approach might be warranted.
- **Bayesian Updates:** While acknowledging potential breakthroughs, the lack of recent record-breaking ages suggests caution in assuming rapid increases.
- **Wide Intervals and Bias Avoidance:** Given the uncertainty and long time horizon, a balanced approach that slightly favors conservatism may be prudent.

**Synthesis:**
To balance optimism with historical trends, a final distribution can be synthesized by averaging the forecasters' estimates, leaning slightly towards conservatism in the upper percentiles.

Final Percentiles:
- Percentile 10: 123
- Percentile 20: 125.5
- Percentile 40: 129
- Percentile 60: 133.5
- Percentile 80: 139.5
- Percentile 90: 145
