### Overview

The question pertains to the age of the oldest verified human being as of the year 2100, with the outcome determined by the official Guinness World Records. As of now, the oldest verified person recorded by Guinness is Jeanne Calment, who lived to be 122 years and 164 days old, passing away in 1997.

### Current Knowledge and Context

1. **Historical Context:**
   - Jeanne Calment holds the record as the oldest verified human. The record lifespan of 122 years is recognized as the upper limit for human longevity based on current verified documentation.

2. **Longevity Studies:**
   - Current research in gerontology and aging indicates that human life expectancy is gradually increasing, primarily due to advancements in healthcare, nutrition, and living conditions. However, the limits of human lifespan appear to remain approximately around 120-125 years biologically, as suggested by various scientists.
   - There are discussions regarding potential 'supercentenarians' (people aged 110 years and older), but very few reach beyond 115, with Jeanne Calment being an exceptional case.

3. **Potential Long-Term Trends:**
   - **Technological Advances:** Breakthroughs in medical science (such as regenerative medicine, gene therapy, and biotechnology) may extend lifespan significantly. However, as of now, no credible evidence suggests that extending human longevity beyond Jeanne Calment's record is approaching.
   - **Consensus among Experts:** Most gerontologists agree that while life expectancy may rise, surpassing documented human records in verified instances is unlikely in the near future.

4. **Statistical Outlook:**
   - There are very few verified supercentenarians, and the rate of individuals reaching such ages is low compared to the overall population. The base rate for achieving such ages historically suggests that even if the number of centenarians will increase, the record for the oldest person will likely stand unchanged.
   
5. **Missing Influences:**
   - While advancements are significant, the influence of genetic, environmental, and social factors that contribute to lifespan cannot be overlooked. Aging is a complex systemic process, and while some may live longer due to specific interventions, it’s premature to assert a significant shift in maximum lifespan records.

### Resolution Criteria Assessment

Based on the current landscape of longevity records, experts’ opinions, and historical data:

- **Current Record:** Jeanne Calment’s record stands at 122 years and 164 days.
- **Prospects for 2100:** Without clear advancements that would push biological limits beyond current verified records, the likelihood of surpassing Calment’s age appears exceedingly low.

### Conclusion

- **Expected Resolution:** Based on the available data and expert consensus, it is reasonable to conclude that the age of the oldest verified human as of 2100 will likely still conform to the existing record (Yes, the oldest person will be less than or equal to 122 years and 164 days, as per Guinness World Records).
- **Final Note:** Continuous monitoring of longevity-related developments will remain essential, as breakthroughs could theoretically alter this outlook, but as of now, no indications support this.

Reasoning from forecaster3 for URL dummy://test.com: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: 75 years (from 2025 to 2100).

(b) The outcome if nothing changed: 122 years (Jeanne Calment’s verified record remains unbroken; no medical, technological, or societal advances improve maximum human longevity).

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: 125–130 years. Life expectancy at birth continues to rise slowly (~2–3 years per decade), and marginal improvements in geriatric medicine, preventative care, and metabolic health may allow a few individuals to surpass 122 by small increments—but still within biological constraints observed in supercentenarian studies.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets: Most gerontologists and demographers (e.g., from Max Planck Institute, S. Jay Olshansky, Vaupel cohort) believe maximum lifespan is biologically capped near 125 years absent radical breakthroughs. Markets (e.g., longevity biotech investments) are betting on healthspan extension, not necessarily lifespan extension beyond ~125. No major prediction market currently prices in records above 130 by 2100.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: Global collapse due to climate instability, nuclear war, or engineered pandemics leads to breakdown of medical infrastructure, malnutrition, and loss of geriatric care. Even if some survive, record verification ceases or becomes impossible. The oldest person verified might be under 115 due to regression in societal stability and data integrity.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: Rapid breakthrough in epigenetic reprogramming, senolytics, CRISPR-based aging reversal, or AI-designed therapeutics achieves biological age reversal in humans by 2050. Combined with perfect digital health monitoring and global equitable access, multiple individuals survive past 140 by 2090, with the oldest reaching 155–160. Guinness verifies under strict protocols.

Reasoning from forecaster4 for URL dummy://test.com: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: 75 years (from 2025 to 2100).

(b) The outcome if nothing changed: The current record is 122 years, so if nothing changes, the age of the oldest verified human as of 2100 would still be 122 years.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: Current trends in medicine and healthcare suggest a gradual increase in life expectancy, but not necessarily a significant increase beyond the current record. Thus, if trends continue, the age of the oldest human might marginally exceed 122 years but is unlikely to increase dramatically.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets: Most experts in gerontology and biology expect that while life expectancy will increase, the upper limit of human lifespan is likely to remain around 120-125 years. Market sentiment and consensus among experts suggest that surpassing Jeanne Calment's record is unlikely.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: If a global health crisis significantly shortens overall life expectancy or if there are no significant breakthroughs in aging research, the oldest human age might not surpass 122 years or could even be below the current record.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: Rapid advancements in biotechnology, such as successful anti-aging therapies or gene editing, could theoretically extend human lifespan beyond 122 years, potentially reaching ages closer to 150 years by 2100.

Reasoning from forecaster4 for URL dummy://test.com: ### Analysis and Forecast for the Age of the Oldest Human as of 2100

#### (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known:
75 years (2100 - 2025).

#### (b) The outcome if nothing changed:
If nothing changes, the record for the oldest verified human would remain at 122 years and 164 days, as there have been no indications of surpassing this age based on current data.

#### (c) The outcome if the current trend continued:
If current trends in healthcare and longevity improvements continue at a similar pace, there would be a slight increase in average life expectancy. However, reaching beyond the current record of 122 years is unlikely without significant medical breakthroughs.

#### (d) The expectations of experts and markets:
Experts in gerontology and longevity studies generally agree that while life expectancy may continue to rise, the maximum lifespan is likely capped around the current record of 122 years. The market for longevity-related products and treatments is growing, but substantial leaps beyond this record are not anticipated by most experts.

#### (e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome:
An unexpected global event such as a catastrophic pandemic or widespread environmental degradation could lead to significant reductions in life expectancy and lifespan, making it unlikely for anyone to surpass or even approach the current record of 122 years.

#### (f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome:
A breakthrough in anti-aging technology, such as the discovery of a major longevity gene or a successful anti-aging drug, could dramatically extend the human lifespan. If such a breakthrough occurred and became widely available, it could result in individuals surpassing the current record by a significant margin, possibly reaching ages close to or even slightly above 150 years.

### Final Forecast:

Considering the above points and adopting a humble and wide-ranging approach to account for unknown unknowns, the final forecast for the age of the oldest human as of 2100 is as follows:

```
Percentile 10: 110
Percentile 20: 115
Percentile 40: 120
Percentile 60: 122
Percentile 80: 125
Percentile 90: 130
```

These percentiles represent a cautious but comprehensive estimate, accounting for potential advancements while anchoring to the current record and expert consensus.

Reasoning from forecaster6 for URL dummy://test.com:  (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known:
Given that today is September 10, 2025, there are approximately 74 years and 3 months until January 1, 2100, when we would know the age of the oldest human being as of that year.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed:
If nothing in the current understanding of human longevity changed, the oldest person in 2100 would likely be similar in age to the current record holder, Jeanne Calment, who lived to be 122 years and 164 days old.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued:
If the current trend of gradual increase in life expectancy continued but did not significantly alter the biological limits of human aging, we might see more individuals reaching ages close to or slightly beyond Jeanne Calment's record, but not a dramatic increase.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets:
Experts generally agree that while life expectancy is increasing, the maximum human lifespan is not likely to increase substantially. The consensus is that the record set by Jeanne Calment may stand for some time, with only modest increases in the age of the oldest humans.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome:
An unexpected global health crisis, such as a pandemic more severe than COVID-19, could reverse the gains in life expectancy and reduce the age of the oldest humans due to increased mortality and reduced access to healthcare, which could disproportionately affect the elderly.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome:
A breakthrough in anti-aging technology or medicine, such as effective age-reversal therapies or the discovery of a "fountain of youth" gene variant, could significantly extend the human lifespan. This could lead to a rapid increase in the maximum age of humans, potentially doubling the current record.

Given the uncertainties and the limitations of current science, it is important to maintain a wide range of possibilities in the forecast. Here are the percentiles:

"
Percentile 10: 105
Percentile 20: 110
Percentile 40: 115
Percentile 60: 120
Percentile 80: 125
Percentile 90: 130
"

This distribution reflects the current record while allowing for a modest increase in human longevity due to potential advancements. It also accounts for the possibility of unforeseen events that could either reduce life expectancy or lead to breakthroughs that significantly extend it.

Reasoning from forecaster6 for URL dummy://test.com:  (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known:
As of today, September 10, 2025, there are approximately 75 years left until the year 2100. This is the time frame within which the outcome of the oldest human's age will be known.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed:
If nothing changed and the current record held by Jeanne Calment remained unbroken, the oldest human as of 2100 would be 122 years and 164 days.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued:
If the current trend of gradual increases in average lifespan continued, we might see more individuals reaching ages closer to Jeanne Calment's record. However, given the slow pace of change and the biological limits observed thus far, it is unlikely that the maximum lifespan would increase significantly. Therefore, the oldest human might still be around 120-125 years old.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets:
Experts generally agree that while life expectancy may increase, the biological limits of human lifespan will likely result in the record age remaining around the current record of 122 years and 164 days. The market for longevity research is optimistic but not to the extent that a dramatic extension of the maximum lifespan is expected by 2100.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome:
An unexpected global health crisis or widespread ecological degradation could reverse the progress in life expectancy, leading to a decrease in the average human lifespan and reducing the chances of anyone reaching the age of 122 again by 2100.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome:
A breakthrough in anti-aging technology, such as the discovery of a way to effectively halt or reverse the aging process through advanced regenerative therapies or gene editing, could dramatically extend the human lifespan. This could potentially result in individuals living well beyond 122 years, possibly even approaching 150-160 years of age.

Given the uncertainties and the current state of knowledge, the following is my final answer with wide confidence intervals to account for unknown unknowns:

"
Percentile 10: 100
Percentile 20: 105
Percentile 40: 110
Percentile 60: 120
Percentile 80: 123
Percentile 90: 130
"

This forecast reflects a cautious approach, acknowledging the possibility of stagnation or even a decrease in maximum lifespan due to unforeseen circumstances (10th percentile), while also allowing for the chance of a significant breakthrough in longevity research (90th percentile). The majority of the distribution is centered around the current record, reflecting the consensus that major changes to the maximum human lifespan are unlikely in the next 75 years.

Reasoning from forecaster3 for URL dummy://test.com: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: 75 years (from 2025 to 2100).

(b) The outcome if nothing changed: 122 years (Jeanne Calment’s verified record remains unbroken).

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: Very slow upward creep — perhaps 123–125 years, as the number of supercentenarians increases slightly due to better healthcare and recordkeeping, but no breakthrough extends maximum lifespan.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets: Most gerontologists and demographers believe the biological limit is near 120–125 years, and that reaching even 125 by 2100 would be remarkable. Markets (e.g., longevity biotech investments) are optimistic but focused on healthspan, not verified maximum lifespan records. No major prediction market currently prices in >130 by 2100 with high probability.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: A global catastrophe (e.g., nuclear winter, engineered pandemic, or AI-driven resource collapse) disrupts healthcare, nutrition, and recordkeeping systems globally. Supercentenarians become rarer, and verification fails. The oldest verified person in 2100 may be as low as 105–110 due to systemic collapse and loss of institutional continuity.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: A longevity “escape velocity” is reached via combination therapies (senolytics, epigenetic reprogramming, telomere extension, organ regeneration) that delay aging nonlinearly. The first “150-year-old” is verified in 2095 — not by living slowly, but by biological age reversal. Verification systems remain robust, and Guinness accepts biomarker-confirmed age deceleration. This would be an outlier driven by exponential biotech progress currently unforeseen.

—

Final forecast incorporates:
- Base rate: 95% of supercentenarian records since 1900 fall between 110–122. Calment is 3+ SD outlier.
- Outside view: Very few verified cases above 117. Probability of exceeding 122 is low even with population growth.
- Inside view: Biotech progress is real but faces biological complexity, regulatory hurdles, and verification challenges.
- Unknown unknowns: 75 years is a long time — we didn’t predict mRNA vaccines in 1945.
- Humility: Wide confidence intervals account for black swans in science, politics, and global stability.

Reasoning from forecaster5 for URL dummy://test.com: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: 75 years (from 2025 to 2100).  

(b) The outcome if nothing changed: 122 years (the current Guinness World Records record held by Jeanne Calment would remain unbroken).  

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: Approximately 122 years. While life expectancy at birth rises gradually, the maximum verified lifespan (120–125 years) has shown little upward trend historically, so the record is likely to stay near 122.  

(d) The expectations of experts and markets: Most gerontologists and experts in aging consensus that surpassing Jeanne Calment’s 122-year record is highly unlikely in the near term (e.g., by 2100). Mainstream markets (if they existed for this) would likely reflect this, pricing in a low probability of exceeding 122.  

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: A global catastrophic event (e.g., a severe pandemic, nuclear conflict, or irreversible environmental collapse) that collapses healthcare systems, reduces access to nutrition/medicine, and sharply limits life expectancy. In such a scenario, the number of supercentenarians could plummet, and the oldest verified human might only reach ~110–115 years.  

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: A transformative medical breakthrough (e.g., safe, widespread "aging reversal" via epigenetic editing, regenerative medicine, or radical life extension therapies) that extends healthy lifespan far beyond current biological limits. If such a technology were developed and accessible by 2100, a small number of individuals might live to 150–200 years, breaking the 122-year record.

Reasoning from forecaster5 for URL dummy://test.com: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: 75 years (from 2025 to 2100).  

(b) The outcome if nothing changed: 122 years. This assumes no advancements in medicine or lifespan extension, so the current Guinness World Records record of 122 years (Jeanne Calment) remains unbroken.  

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: 122–125 years. While life expectancy rises, the maximum verified lifespan has historically plateaued around 120–125 years. Even with trends of more centenarians, the upper limit of verified longevity is unlikely to exceed this range without major breakthroughs.  

(d) The expectations of experts and markets: Most gerontologists and researchers expect the record to stay near 122 years, as biological limits to human lifespan (e.g., cellular aging, genomic constraints) are not yet proven to be overcome. Mainstream markets (if they existed for this) would likely reflect this consensus, with low odds of surpassing 125 years.  

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: A global pandemic or widespread collapse of healthcare systems (e.g., due to climate disasters or conflict) could decimate supercentenarian populations and prevent any individuals from reaching ages beyond 115–120 years. For example, a highly contagious disease targeting the elderly might kill all remaining supercentenarians by 2080, leaving the oldest human in 2100 at ~110–115 years (still above the 100-year minimum).  

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: A revolutionary anti-aging therapy (e.g., targeted senolytics, gene editing to repair aging-related DNA damage, or regenerative medicine for organ rejuvenation) could extend healthy lifespan by 30–50 years. If such a therapy is developed and widely accessible by 2050, a small number of individuals might live to 150–170 years, pushing the maximum verified age to ~160 years by 2100.

Reasoning from forecaster6 for URL dummy://test.com:  (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: 75 years (from 2025 to 2100).

(b) The outcome if nothing changed: 122 years and 164 days, as this is the current record held by Jeanne Calment according to Guinness World Records.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: Given that the trend in increase of life expectancy is slow and that reaching ages beyond 110 years is extremely rare, it is likely that the record would remain close to the current one, possibly slightly higher due to improvements in healthcare and living conditions, but not significantly.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets: Experts generally agree that while life expectancy may increase, the maximum human lifespan is unlikely to extend significantly beyond the current record. Therefore, the expectations would be that the age of the oldest human by 2100 would likely be close to, but not exceed by much, the age of Jeanne Calment.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: An unexpected global health crisis that is not effectively managed could lead to a decrease in life expectancy due to the strain on healthcare systems, reduced access to medical care, and economic downturns affecting health outcomes. This could potentially result in a lower maximum age at death.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: A breakthrough in anti-aging therapies, such as effective regenerative treatments, personalized medicine, or a widespread adoption of a healthier lifestyle, could significantly extend human longevity. If such advancements were to occur and be widely available, the maximum age could potentially exceed current expectations.

Given the constraints and the need to account for a wide range of possible outcomes, my final answer, expressed as a series of percentiles, would be:

"
Percentile 10: 120
Percentile 20: 122
Percentile 40: 125
Percentile 60: 128
Percentile 80: 130
Percentile 90: 135
"

This distribution reflects the uncertainty and the potential for modest increases in the maximum human lifespan by 2100. It is anchored on the current record and expert consensus but allows for the possibility of incremental advancements in longevity research. It also accounts for the possibility of unexpected breakthroughs, albeit with a lower probability.

Reasoning from forecaster6 for URL dummy://test.com:  (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known:
Approximately 75 years, from 2025 to 2100.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed:
If no significant advancements are made in extending human longevity, the age of the oldest human in 2100 would likely remain around the current record held by Jeanne Calment, which is 122 years and 164 days.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued:
If the current trends in healthcare, biotechnology, and medical science continue, we might see a modest increase in the average human lifespan. However, given the complex nature of aging and the rarity of supercentenarians, the maximum lifespan may not increase significantly. The oldest person could potentially reach an age slightly higher than the current record, perhaps in the range of 125 to 130 years.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets:
Experts generally expect that advancements in medicine and technology will lead to a gradual increase in average life expectancy, but they are more cautious about the prospects of significantly extending the maximum human lifespan. Most expect that the record for the oldest person will be difficult to break and may not be surpassed by much, if at all, by 2100.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome:
An unexpected global crisis, such as a catastrophic pandemic, environmental collapse, or a series of international conflicts, could reverse the progress in healthcare and lead to a decline in life expectancy and maximum lifespan. In such a scenario, the age of the oldest human by 2100 could potentially decrease compared to today's standards.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome:
A breakthrough in regenerative medicine, such as successful full-body rejuvenation therapies or anti-aging gene editing techniques, could drastically extend the human lifespan. If such treatments became widely available and effective, the maximum human lifespan could potentially exceed 150 years, with the oldest person alive in 2100 reaching an age in that range.

Considering the wide range of uncertainties and the need to account for unknown unknowns, the forecast should be made with a broad distribution:

"
Percentile 10: 105
Percentile 20: 110
Percentile 40: 115
Percentile 60: 123
Percentile 80: 128
Percentile 90: 133
"

This distribution reflects the understanding that while significant breakthroughs could potentially extend human lifespan, there is a great deal of uncertainty and the likelihood of such breakthroughs occurring within the necessary timeframe to affect the oldest person by 2100 is currently speculative. The base rate (outside view) suggests that the record will be difficult to surpass, but the inside view allows for the possibility of technological advancements that could extend life beyond current expectations.

**Rationale**:  
- Anchoring on Jeanne Calment’s **122** as the base case (~20th–40th percentile), reflecting persistent biological limits.  
- Slow progress (~1–2 additional years per decade) guides the **60th percentile (128)**.  
- Upper percentiles account for speculative but plausible biomedical leaps (e.g., targeting aging pathways), constrained by the ~75-year timeframe from 2025.  
- Conservative tail (**10th percentile: 118**) avoids dismissing mild regression in lifespan trends.

Reasoning from forecaster6 for URL dummy://test.com:  (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known:
Approximately 75 years, from 2025 to 2100.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed:
If nothing changed, the age of the oldest human as of 2100 would likely remain at or near the current record of 122 years and 164 days, as set by Jeanne Calment.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued:
If the current trend in medical and technological advancements continues, we might see an incremental increase in human longevity, potentially extending the maximum lifespan by a few years. However, this would likely not be sufficient to dramatically exceed the current record.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets:
Experts generally expect a gradual increase in average life expectancy due to improvements in healthcare, nutrition, and living conditions. However, there is skepticism about the likelihood of regularly surpassing the current maximum lifespan record of 122 years and 164 days.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome:
An unexpected global crisis, such as a catastrophic pandemic, could lead to a significant decline in healthcare quality and life expectancy, thereby reducing the chances of anyone reaching extreme old age by 2100.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome:
A breakthrough in anti-aging technology or gene editing could dramatically extend human lifespan, allowing individuals to live significantly longer than the current record, potentially reaching ages well into the 130s or even 140s.

Given these considerations and aiming to maintain a humble and wide confidence interval, I will provide a range of outcomes that account for the uncertainty inherent in such long-term predictions:

"
Percentile 10: 100
Percentile 20: 105
Percentile 40: 110
Percentile 60: 115
Percentile 80: 120
Percentile 90: 125
"

This distribution reflects a conservative estimate that takes into account both the historical consistency of the maximum human lifespan and the potential for modest gains in longevity due to future medical advancements. It also acknowledges the possibility of unforeseen breakthroughs that could extend the maximum lifespan further, albeit with a lower probability.

Reasoning from forecaster4 for URL dummy://test.com: ### (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.
- There are 75 years remaining until the year 2100.

### (b) The outcome if nothing changed.
- If nothing changed from the current record, the oldest human age as of 2100 would be 122 years and 164 days, as held by Jeanne Calment.

### (c) The outcome if the current trend continued.
- If the current trend of gradual increases in life expectancy due to advancements in healthcare, nutrition, and living conditions continues, we might see a slight increase in the average age of supercentenarians, but biological limits suggest that it would still be close to the current record.

### (d) The expectations of experts and markets.
- Most gerontologists and experts in aging agree that while life expectancy may increase, surpassing the documented human longevity record of 122 years remains unlikely. The market for longevity-focused technologies is growing, but a significant breakthrough that extends the maximum human lifespan well beyond current records is not anticipated by 2100.

### (e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome.
- An unexpected global health crisis or a catastrophic event that significantly reduces overall health and life expectancy could result in a scenario where the oldest human age remains below 122 years by 2100.

### (f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome.
- An unexpected breakthrough in biotechnology, such as the discovery of a way to halt or reverse key aging processes, could extend human lifespan significantly beyond the current record. This could include advances in genomic editing, regenerative medicine, or other technologies that radically alter our understanding of aging.

### Final Answer:
"
Percentile 10: 120
Percentile 20: 121
Percentile 40: 122
Percentile 60: 123
Percentile 80: 125

Reasoning from forecaster5 for URL dummy://test.com: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: 75 years (from 2025 to 2100).  

(b) The outcome if nothing changed: 122 years (the current Guinness World Records record held by Jeanne Calment, as no new advancements or individuals surpassing this age would emerge).  

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: 122–123 years (historical maximum lifespan has plateaued around 120–125 years despite rising life expectancy; the trend of stable maximum lifespan, not just life expectancy, would persist).  

(d) The expectations of experts and markets: Most gerontologists and longevity researchers expect the record to remain near 122 years, as no credible evidence supports biological limits being exceeded in the near term. Formal markets (if they existed) would likely price in minimal upside beyond 122, reflecting consensus skepticism about radical lifespan extension.  

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: A global catastrophic event (e.g., a prolonged pandemic, nuclear conflict, or climate collapse) that collapses healthcare systems, reduces access to nutrition/medicine, and drastically limits survival to old age. For example, if 90% of supercentenarians (age 110+) are lost, the new maximum verified age by 2100 could drop to 110–115 years.  

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: A breakthrough in anti-aging science (e.g., targeted gene therapy to repair senescent cells, regenerative medicine to replace organs indefinitely, or a "longevity pill" that extends healthy lifespan by 30–50 years) that is widely accessible by 2100. This could push the maximum verified age to 150–200 years, though such a scenario is currently unproven and speculative.

Reasoning from forecaster6 for URL dummy://test.com:  (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: 75 years (from 2025 to 2100).

(b) The outcome if nothing changed: Approximately 122 years, which is the current record held by Jeanne Calment.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: Assuming a continuation of current trends in medical and technological advancements without any breakthroughs that significantly extend human lifespan, the oldest age would likely remain around 120-125 years.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets: Experts generally believe that while life expectancy may continue to increase, the biological limits of human longevity are unlikely to be significantly surpassed in the near future. Therefore, the age of the oldest person by 2100 might not be much higher than the current record, with most expectations clustering around the 120-125 year range.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: An unexpected global crisis, such as a widespread and deadly pandemic that disproportionately affects the elderly, could lead to a decrease in life expectancy and halt advancements in longevity research. This could result in the oldest human by 2100 being younger than the current record holder, possibly around 110-115 years.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: A breakthrough in anti-aging medicine, such as the development of a highly effective treatment that significantly slows down the aging process, could lead to a substantial increase in human lifespan. This could result in the oldest human by 2100 being significantly older than the current record, potentially reaching ages like 150-160 years.

Given these considerations, my final answer, reflecting a range of plausible outcomes with wide confidence intervals, is:

"
Percentile 10: 110
Percentile 20: 115
Percentile 40: 120
Percentile 60: 125
Percentile 80: 135
Percentile 90: 150
"

These percentiles reflect the uncertainty around the potential advancements in longevity research and the possibility of unforeseen events, while also taking into account the current scientific consensus and historical trends. The lower end of the distribution accounts for scenarios where no significant advancements are made or where global events could negatively impact life expectancy. The higher end acknowledges the potential for major breakthroughs in the field of gerontology.
