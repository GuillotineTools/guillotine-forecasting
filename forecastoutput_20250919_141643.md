**Article 1: Longevity Records and Trends**

The current verified record for human longevity is 122 years, held by Jeanne Calment. Advances in healthcare, nutrition, and living conditions have gradually increased life expectancy over the past century. Researchers are exploring genetic factors, lifestyle changes, and medical interventions that could further extend human life. Some scientists believe that with breakthroughs in areas like regenerative medicine and anti-aging therapies, humans could potentially live beyond 130 years by the end of the century.

**Article 2: Medical Advances and Longevity**

Recent medical advancements, including gene editing and personalized medicine, show promise for extending human lifespan. Technologies such as CRISPR and stem cell therapy are being researched for their potential to repair age-related damage and slow aging processes. While ethical and technical challenges remain, ongoing research could lead to significant increases in maximum human lifespan. Experts caution that while technology may extend life, factors like environmental changes and healthcare access will also play critical roles.

**Article 3: Societal Implications of Increased Longevity**

Increasing human lifespan poses challenges and opportunities. Longer lifespans could strain pension systems and healthcare resources but also allow for extended careers and contributions to society. Policymakers are urged to consider the implications of an aging population and invest in sustainable healthcare solutions. The balance between extending life and ensuring quality of life remains a key consideration.
