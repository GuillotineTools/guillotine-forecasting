Reasoning from forecaster1 for URL dummy://test.com: 1. **Rephrase and Expand the Question:**
   What will be the age of the oldest verified human in the world as officially recorded by Guinness World Records by the year 2100? The current record for the oldest human is 122 years, and ongoing advancements in medical science, particularly in anti-aging research, could potentially extend this record. The question seeks to estimate the age of the oldest living person by the end of the 21st century, considering the possibility of breakthroughs in longevity.

2. **Base Rate/Extreme Outcomes:**
   Historically, the record for the oldest human has increased slowly and not linearly. The current record is held by Jeanne Calment, who lived to 122 years and 164 days, a record that has stood since 1997. Extreme outcomes would involve surpassing this record significantly, possibly due to medical breakthroughs or changes in lifestyle and healthcare.

3. **Estimate a Reasonable Range:**
   A reasonable lower bound could be the current record of 122 years, assuming no significant advancements. An upper bound could be around 150 years, considering optimistic scenarios where major breakthroughs in anti-aging and healthcare occur.

4. **Factors for Lower Range:**
   - No significant breakthroughs in anti-aging research.
   - Potential setbacks in healthcare or global health crises.
   - Ethical, social, or economic factors limiting access to life-extending technologies.

5. **Factors for Upper Range:**
   - Significant advancements in genetics, biotechnology, and personalized medicine.
   - Widespread adoption of healthy lifestyles and preventive healthcare.
   - Breakthroughs in understanding and reversing aging processes.

6. **Aggregate Considerations:**
   Given the slow historical increase in longevity records and potential for breakthroughs, the most likely scenario lies between modest increases and optimistic breakthroughs. The distribution should reflect a higher probability around modest increases with a long tail towards significant breakthroughs.

7. **Initial Probability Distribution:**
   - Percentile 10: 123
   - Percentile 20: 125
   - Percentile 40: 128
   - Percentile 60: 132
   - Percentile 80: 140
   - Percentile 90: 145

8. **Evaluate Confidence:**
   The initial distribution may be slightly optimistic given the historical data and current pace of advancements. It's essential to account for the uncertainty in breakthroughs and potential global challenges that could affect longevity.

9. **Final Probability Distribution:**
   - Percentile 10: *123*
   - Percentile 20: *125*
   - Percentile 40: *127*
   - Percentile 60: *130*

Reasoning from forecaster2 for URL dummy://test.com: ### 1. Rephrased and Expanded Question  
"What will be the age of the oldest verified human alive or recorded as of 2100, according to the official Guinness World Records, given current trends in anti-aging medicine, biotechnology, and demographic shifts?"  

### 2. Base Rate/Historical Precedents  
- The current verified record is Jeanne Calment (122 years, 164 days).  
- Only a handful of humans have reached 117+ years, suggesting extreme age is rare even with modern medicine.  
- Lifespan extension progress has been incremental; the record has increased by ~10 years over the last century.  

### 3. Reasonable Range Estimate  
- **Lower bound**: 122 years (no new record).  
- **Upper bound**: 150 years (assuming radical breakthroughs in senolytics, gene therapy, or AI-driven medicine).  

### 4. Factors Pushing Toward Lower End (122–130)  
- Slow progress in anti-aging research due to funding gaps or regulatory hurdles.  
- Societal collapse (e.g., climate disasters, pandemics) reducing lifespans.  
- Ethical restrictions on life-extension technologies.  

### 5. Factors Pushing Toward Upper End (130–150)  
- Success in geroscience (e.g., rapamycin, NAD+ boosters, CRISPR).  
- AI-accelerated drug discovery or personalized medicine.  
- Wealthy individuals investing heavily in longevity (e.g., Altos Labs, Calico).  

### 6. Aggregation  
- Median estimate: ~130 years (moderate progress).  
- Tail risks: Low chance of no progress (~122) or radical breakthroughs (~150).  

### 7. Initial Probability Distribution (Percentiles)  
- 10%: ≤122  
- 20%: ≤125  
- 40%: ≤128  
- 60%: ≤132  
- 80%: ≤140  
- 90%: ≤145  

### 8. Calibration Check  
- Initial distribution may be overly optimistic about upper tail (e.g., 150 is speculative). Adjust upper percentiles downward slightly.  

### 9. Final Probability Distribution  
- Percentile 10: *122*  
- Percentile 20: *125*  
- Percentile 40: *128*  
- Percentile 60: *131*  
- Percentile 80: *138*  
- Percentile 90: *143*  

### Rationale for Adjustments  
- Reduced upper bounds to reflect uncertainty about "moonshot" breakthroughs.  
- Kept lower end conservative due to historical rarity of extreme ages.  
- Median (~130) aligns with linear extrapolation of past progress + modest acceleration.

Reasoning from forecaster3 for URL dummy://test.com: 1.  Rephrase & expand  
    “On 31 Dec 2099, what age (in completed years) will the oldest living human whose birth has been documented and whose age has been verified by Guinness World Records have reached?”  
    All the usual Guinness rules apply: original birth certificate or other primary civil record, continuous documentary chain, no gaps or conflicting evidence, and the person must be alive on the census date.

2.  Base-rate / historical precedents  
    – Verified maximum lifespan has risen only ~1 year per decade since the 1970s.  
    – The 122 yr 164 d record (Jeanne Calment, 1875-1997) has stood for 28 years.  
    – The second-oldest ever is 119; the third 117.  The gap between #1 and #10 is only ~5 years, showing a sharp tail.  
    – Mathematical “maximum human lifespan” estimates from extreme-value theory cluster around 125-135 even if every known disease were cured.  
    – No intervention in any mammal has pushed maximum lifespan outward by >20 % without genetic engineering; calorie restriction gives ~10 % in mice.

3.  Reasonable range  
    Lower bound: 122 (record is never broken; or new record is broken just before 2100 but the person dies young).  
    Upper bound: 150 (requires multiple breakthroughs—senolytics, stem-cell renewal, epigenetic reprogramming, cancer cures, etc.—to act additively and be widely deployed before 2050-2060 so that at least one cohort can live to 2100).  
    90 % of my probability mass lies inside 122-150.

4.  Downward drivers  
    – Calment record persists (“tail-fattening” is rare).  
    – Diminishing returns: each extra year above 115 needs exponentially larger repair.  
    – Societal risks: pandemics, war, obesity, antibiotic resistance, climate disruption.  
    – Verification tightening: Guinness increasingly rejects marginal claims.

5.  Upward drivers  
    – Combinatorial geroscience: metformin, rapalogs, senolytics, partial reprogramming, organ regeneration, CRISPR-fixing of progeroid variants.  
    – AI-accelerated drug discovery shortens translation time.  
    – Large self-experimenting communities (bio-hackers, billionaires) create early adopters.  
    – One single outlier is enough; the distribution of “extreme outliers” can shift even if mean lifespan moves little.

6.  Aggregation (super-forecaster style)  
    – Start from the stationary tail: probability the record is still 122 in 2100 ≈ 5 %.  
    – Historical creep gives ~1 year per decade → 122 + 7 ≈ 129 by 2100; assign 15 % around 129.  
    – Biotech upside: 30 % chance that at least one intervention adds 10-25 years for at least one person.  
    – Combine with small but non-zero probability of radical postponement (>25 years).  
    – Use log-normal-ish shape on the interval 122-160, anchored by extreme-value theory asymptote ~135.

7.  Initial percentile distribution  
    10th: 124  
    20th: 126  
    40th: 130  
    60th: 134  
    80th: 140  
    90th: 147

8.  Calibration check  
    – The 80 % interval (124-147) feels slightly narrow; widen lower tail a touch (record could easily stand) and compress the far right tail (150+ needs too many coincidences).  
    – Shift 10th percentile down to 123, 90th down to 145.  
    – Final distribution still carries ~1 % mass above 160 but it is invisible at the requested percentiles.

9.  Final probability distribution (percentiles)

Percentile 10: *123*  
Percentile 20: *126*  
Percentile 40: *130*  
Percentile 60: *134*  
Percentile 80: *140*  
Percentile 90: *145*

Synthesized reasoning (using openrouter/openai/gpt-4o) for URL dummy://test.com: To synthesize a final balanced distribution, let's analyze the agreements and disagreements among the forecasters:

1. **Agreements:**
   - All forecasters agree that the current record of 122 years is a reasonable lower bound.
   - There is consensus that significant breakthroughs could push the upper bound, with most forecasters suggesting an optimistic upper bound around 140-150 years.
   - All forecasters acknowledge the historical slow increase in maximum verified human lifespan.

2. **Disagreements:**
   - Forecasters differ slightly in their estimates of the median and upper percentiles, reflecting varying degrees of optimism about future breakthroughs.
   - The 90th percentile predictions range from 140 to 145, indicating different levels of confidence in extreme longevity scenarios.

3. **Resolution via Heuristics:**
   - **Base Rates:** The historical increase in maximum lifespan suggests a cautious approach, favoring moderate increases.
   - **Bayesian Updates:** Given the slow historical trend, it's reasonable to adjust expectations upwards only slightly unless substantial evidence of breakthroughs emerges.
   - **Wide Intervals:** To account for uncertainty, a wide distribution is appropriate, with more probability mass in the lower to moderate range.
   - **Bias Avoidance:** Avoid over-optimism by placing more weight on historical trends and current scientific progress.

Based on these considerations, the final balanced distribution is:

Percentile 10: 122  
Percentile 20: 125  
Percentile 40: 129  
Percentile 60: 132  
Percentile 80: 138  
Percentile 90: 142
