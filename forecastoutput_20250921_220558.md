Found Research for URL dummy://test.com:
Research on advancements in medicine related to life extension is critical for predicting future human longevity. Although no specific articles were found, the topic remains pertinent to forecasting the age of the oldest human by 2100. The current record for human lifespan is 122 years. Continued progress in medical science, particularly in areas such as genetics, regenerative medicine, and personalized healthcare, could significantly extend human life expectancy. These advancements may lead to breakthroughs that delay aging processes, enhance disease prevention, and improve overall health, potentially increasing the maximum human lifespan by the end of the century.

Reasoning from forecaster1 for URL dummy://test.com: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known:  
75 years (from 2025 to 2100).

(b) The outcome if nothing changed:  
122 years (the current record for the oldest human).

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued:  
The current trend shows gradual increases in life expectancy due to medical advancements. If this trend continues, the age of the oldest human could potentially increase by 10-20 years by 2100, reaching around 132-142 years.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets:  
Experts in gerontology and related fields generally anticipate that continued advancements in medicine, genetics, and technology will lead to an increase in maximum human lifespan. Optimistic projections suggest the possibility of reaching 140-150 years, while more conservative estimates are closer to 130-135 years.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome:  
A global catastrophe, such as a widespread pandemic, nuclear war, or climate disaster, severely impacts human health and longevity, resulting in a stagnation or even reduction in the maximum age, potentially keeping it around 125 years.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome:  
Breakthroughs in anti-aging research, such as effective gene therapies, regenerative medicine, or advanced AI-driven healthcare, lead to dramatic increases in human lifespan, pushing the age of the oldest human to 160 years or more.

Reasoning from forecaster2 for URL dummy://test.com: ### (a) Time left until the outcome is known:  
The outcome will be known by 2100-12-31. From today (2025-09-21), this is **75 years and 3 months** (75.25 years).  

### (b) Outcome if nothing changed:  
If medical advancements stall and no progress is made beyond current capabilities, the oldest human age would likely remain near the current record of **122 years**.  

### (c) Outcome if the current trend continued:  
Assuming gradual progress in life extension technologies (e.g., improved treatments for aging-related diseases, better healthcare access), the oldest human age could increase modestly. Historical trends suggest a slow rise in maximum lifespan (e.g., ~0.3 years per decade). Extrapolating, this would suggest **~125 years by 2100**.  

### (d) Expectations of experts and markets:  
- **Experts**: Many biogerontologists predict incremental gains, with some outliers suggesting breakthroughs (e.g., senolytics, gene editing) could push limits to **130–150 years**.  
- **Markets**: Anti-aging investments are growing, but most predictions are conservative (~125–140 years).  

### (e) Unexpected low outcome scenario:  
A global catastrophe (e.g., pandemic, nuclear war, climate collapse) disrupts healthcare systems and reduces lifespans, capping the record at **110–115 years**.  

### (f) Unexpected high outcome scenario:  
A breakthrough in aging reversal (e.g., epigenetic reprogramming, nanomedicine) or artificial longevity (e.g., brain-computer interfaces) extends the record to **160–180 years**.  

### Final Answer:  
Balancing base rates, trends, and uncertainty:  
- **Percentile 10**: 115 years (minimal progress, setbacks)  
- **Percentile 20**: 122 years (current record, no improvement)  
- **Percentile 40**: 130 years (modest medical advances)  
- **Percentile 60**: 140 years (accelerated aging research)  
- **Percentile 80**: 150 years (major breakthroughs)  
- **Percentile 90**: 170 years (transformative technologies)  

*Note: The 90th percentile is aggressive but accounts for tail risks like exponential progress in biotech.*

Reasoning from forecaster3 for URL dummy://test.com: (a) Time left until outcome is known: 75 years and 3 months (from 21 Sep 2025 to 31 Dec 2100).

(b) If nothing changed (no further medical progress, no new super-centenarian surprises): the record would stay 122 years, but because the calendar will read 2100 we would simply observe whoever is then the oldest living person; in a “frozen-technology” world that individual would probably be ≈ 115–120 years old (the typical ceiling we see today).

(c) If the gentle historical trend of record longevity (+0.15 yr per year) continued: 122 + 0.15 × 75 ≈ 133 years.

(d) Expert & market expectations: Gerontology surveys (Vijg, de Grey, Sinclair, etc.) cluster around 130-150 years for the max by 2100, with a small tail above 150. No credible expert cites > 180. Longevity “moon-shot” investors (e.g., Altos, Calico) implicitly price in a ~25 % chance that someone breaks 150 this century.

(e) Unexpected low scenario: A global backlash against anti-aging research (ethical bans, restrictive regulation) plus a deadly 2030s pandemic that preferentially kills the frail elderly keeps the validated record stuck near 125 years.

(f) Unexpected high scenario: A 2040s breakthrough in partial epigenetic age-reversal (e.g., Yaman-factor in vivo gene therapy) proves safe and is adopted by healthy 90-year-olds, letting a cohort reach 170 years before 2100, with the oldest hitting 185.

Putting the outside-view base-rate (current record + gentle trend) together with the inside-view possibility of a breakthrough but also regulatory or biological friction, I spread my distribution widely yet keep almost all mass below 180. The 90 % interval runs from roughly the trend-line to roughly the optimistic expert tail, with a median near 150.

Reasoning from forecaster4 for URL dummy://test.com: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known:  
75 years (from 2025 to 2100).

(b) The outcome if nothing changed:  
If nothing changed, the record would remain at 122 years.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued:  
The oldest human's age record has increased slowly over the past century. Assuming a continuation of this trend, the record might increase by a few years, potentially reaching around 125-130 years by 2100.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets:  
Experts in gerontology and life extension often predict moderate increases in maximum lifespan due to advancements in medicine and technology. Some optimistic forecasts suggest reaching 140-150 years, while more conservative estimates suggest a smaller increase, possibly up to 130-135 years.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome:  
A global catastrophic event, such as a pandemic or large-scale war, could severely impact human life expectancy and limit advancements in medical research, potentially keeping the maximum lifespan closer to the current record.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome:  
A major breakthrough in genetic engineering or anti-aging technology, such as successfully reversing aging processes or curing age-related diseases, could dramatically increase human lifespan, potentially pushing the record to 160 years or more.
