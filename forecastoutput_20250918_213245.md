To assess the question of what the age of the oldest human will be as of 2100, we need to consider several factors, including current records, trends in human longevity, and expert opinions.

### Current Record
As of October 2023, the oldest verified person is Mar√≠a Branyas Morera, who was born on March 4, 1907, making her 116 years old. The Guinness World Records recognizes her as the oldest living person. The current record for the oldest verified age is 122 years, held by Jeanne Calment, who passed away in 1997.

### Trends in Longevity
1. **Advancements in Healthcare**: There have been significant advancements in healthcare, nutrition, and lifestyle that contribute to increased life expectancy. However, the rate of increase in maximum lifespan has not kept pace with average life expectancy improvements.
   
2. **Maximum Lifespan**: Research suggests that while average life expectancy may continue to rise, the maximum lifespan (the age of the oldest individuals) has remained relatively stable around 120-125 years. Some experts argue that biological limits may prevent humans from living significantly longer than this.

3. **Demographic Changes**: The global population is aging, with a growing number of centenarians. However, the proportion of individuals reaching extreme ages (over 110) remains small.

### Expert Opinions
- **Gerontologists**: Many gerontologists believe that while we may see more people living into their 100s, the likelihood of someone surpassing the current record of 122 years is low. They cite biological limits and the challenges of extreme old age.
- **Longevity Researchers**: Some researchers are optimistic about breakthroughs in genetics and biotechnology that could extend human lifespan, but these are speculative and not yet realized.

### Consensus Views
- The consensus among experts is that while life expectancy may continue to rise, the age of the oldest verified human is unlikely to exceed 125 years by 2100. The current record of 122 years set by Jeanne Calment has stood for over two decades, indicating a potential plateau in maximum lifespan.

### Missing Factors
- **Technological Breakthroughs**: Future advancements in medical technology, genetics, and anti-aging research could potentially alter the landscape of human longevity.
- **Environmental Factors**: Changes in global health crises, climate change, and lifestyle factors could also impact longevity trends.

### Bayesian Updating
- If new evidence emerges regarding significant breakthroughs in anti-aging technology or changes in health policies that dramatically improve longevity, this could shift expectations. However, as of now, the evidence suggests stability in maximum lifespan.

### Conclusion
Based on current information, the age of the oldest human as of 2100 is likely to remain around the current record of 122 years, with a high probability that it will not exceed 125 years. Therefore, the resolution of the question, based on the criteria of the official Guinness record, would likely be **No**, as it is improbable that anyone will surpass the age of 125 by 2100.
