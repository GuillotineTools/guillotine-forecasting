To assess the question of the age of the oldest human as of 2100, we need to consider several factors, including current records, trends in longevity, and expert opinions on aging.

### Current Record
As of October 2023, the oldest verified person is Mar√≠a Branyas Morera, born on March 4, 1907, making her 116 years old. The Guinness World Records recognizes her as the oldest living person. The record for the oldest verified age is currently held by Jeanne Calment, who lived to be 122 years and 164 days, passing away in 1997.

### Trends in Longevity
1. **Advancements in Medicine**: There are ongoing advancements in healthcare, genetics, and biotechnology that may extend human lifespan. Research into anti-aging therapies, regenerative medicine, and improved healthcare access could potentially lead to longer lifespans.
   
2. **Demographic Shifts**: The global population is aging, with a significant increase in the number of centenarians. The United Nations projects that by 2050, the number of people aged 100 and older will increase significantly, which may influence the potential for record-breaking ages.

3. **Historical Context**: Historically, the maximum verified age has not significantly increased beyond 122 years. While there are claims of individuals living longer, they often lack verification.

### Expert Opinions
- **Gerontologists**: Many experts in aging suggest that while the average lifespan may continue to increase, the maximum lifespan (the age of the oldest individual) may not see substantial increases. The biological limits of human aging are still a topic of debate.
- **Demographers**: Some demographers argue that while more people are living longer, the extreme ages (beyond 120) are rare and may not change significantly.

### Consensus Views
The consensus among experts is that while average life expectancy may rise due to better health care and lifestyle changes, the maximum age is likely to remain around the current record of 122 years. There is skepticism about whether anyone will surpass this age by 2100.

### Missing Factors
- **Unforeseen Medical Breakthroughs**: If significant breakthroughs in anti-aging science occur, they could dramatically change the landscape of human longevity.
- **Global Health Crises**: Factors such as pandemics, climate change, and geopolitical instability could impact health and longevity trends.

### Bayesian Updating
- **Base Rate**: The historical maximum age of verified humans is 122 years. This serves as a strong base rate for forecasting.
- **Current Trends**: While there are indications of increasing longevity, the extreme age record has remained stable for decades.

### Conclusion
Based on current information, the age of the oldest human as of 2100 is likely to be around the historical maximum of 122 years, barring any unforeseen medical advancements. Therefore, the resolution of the question, based on the criteria of the official Guinness record, would likely be **No**, as it is improbable that anyone will exceed this age by 2100.
