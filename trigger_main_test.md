# Trigger Main Test
This commit will trigger the main uv-enhanced workflow to run and verify outputs.

## Expected Results:
1. ✅ UV dependency installation works
2. ✅ API connectivity test passes
3. ✅ Brightline Watch tournament discovery works
4. ✅ Complete multiforecaster runs with detailed logging
5. ✅ Outputs are auto-committed to repository

## Will Create:
- brightline_tournament_info_*.md files
- real_question_multiforecaster_*.md files
- Auto-committed outputs showing exact model responses

Let's verify the complete working system!
