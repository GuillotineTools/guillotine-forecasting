Found Research for URL dummy://test.com:
To assess the question of what the age of the oldest human will be as of 2100, we need to consider several factors, including current records, trends in human longevity, and expert opinions.

### Current Record
As of October 2023, the oldest verified person is María Branyas Morera, born on March 4, 1907, making her 116 years old. The Guinness World Records recognizes her as the oldest living person. The record for the oldest verified age is held by Jeanne Calment, who lived to be 122 years and 164 days, passing away in 1997.

### Trends in Longevity
1. **Increasing Life Expectancy**: Global life expectancy has been steadily increasing due to advancements in healthcare, nutrition, and living conditions. However, the rate of increase has slowed in recent years, particularly due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on health systems.
   
2. **Supercentenarians**: The number of supercentenarians (people aged 110 and older) has been rising, but they remain extremely rare. As of now, there are only a few dozen verified supercentenarians worldwide.

3. **Genetic and Environmental Factors**: Research indicates that genetics play a significant role in longevity, but environmental factors, lifestyle choices, and healthcare access are also critical. The Blue Zones, regions where people live significantly longer, provide insights into lifestyle factors that contribute to longevity.

### Expert Opinions
- **Gerontologists**: Experts in aging suggest that while some individuals may live beyond 120, the biological limits of human lifespan are still debated. Some argue that the maximum lifespan may be capped around 120-125 years.
- **Demographers**: They project that while life expectancy will continue to rise, the number of individuals reaching extreme ages (e.g., 120+) will remain low.

### Missing Factors
- **Future Medical Advances**: Potential breakthroughs in biotechnology, genetics, and regenerative medicine could significantly alter the landscape of aging and longevity. However, predicting the timing and impact of such advancements is highly uncertain.
- **Global Health Trends**: Factors such as pandemics, climate change, and socioeconomic disparities could influence health outcomes and longevity in unpredictable ways.

### Consensus Views
The consensus among experts suggests that while it is possible for individuals to live beyond 120 years, the likelihood of someone reaching or exceeding Jeanne Calment's record by 2100 remains uncertain. The current trajectory of aging research and healthcare improvements may allow for longer lifespans, but the biological limits of human life are still a significant consideration.

### Resolution Criteria
Given the current information and trends, the question of the age of the oldest human as of 2100 will likely hinge on whether a new record is set that exceeds 122 years and 164 days. Based on the current understanding of human longevity and the rarity of supercentenarians, it is plausible that the oldest verified age could remain below this threshold, but advancements in science could change this.

### Conclusion
As of now, it is uncertain whether the age of the oldest human as of 2100 will exceed the current record of 122 years and 164 days. The outcome could resolve as "No" based on current trends and expert consensus, but significant advancements in longevity science could lead to a different outcome. Continuous monitoring of developments in aging research and demographic trends will be essential for updating this assessment.

Reasoning from forecaster3 for URL dummy://test.com: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: 75 years (from 2025 to 2100).

(b) The outcome if nothing changed: 122.5 (Jeanne Calment’s record remains unbroken; no medical or societal progress occurs).

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: Slight upward creep — perhaps 125–128 years. Supercentenarian numbers are increasing slowly, and record-breaking ages have stagnated since 1997, but demographic momentum and improved record-keeping may push the verified maximum slightly higher even without radical breakthroughs.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets: Most gerontologists and demographers believe 125 is plausible but 130+ is unlikely without major scientific breakthroughs. Markets (e.g., longevity biotech investments) are betting on moderate progress — perhaps extending healthy lifespan more than maximum lifespan. No major prediction market exists specifically for “oldest human in 2100,” but expert surveys (e.g., from Pew, Max Planck Institute) suggest median expectations around 124–127, with long tails.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: Global collapse due to climate catastrophe, nuclear war, or engineered pandemic wipes out advanced healthcare systems and destabilizes record-keeping. Even if some individuals survive, verification fails, or life expectancy plummets due to resource scarcity and disease resurgence. The oldest verified person in 2100 might be only 110–115 due to systemic collapse.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: Breakthroughs in senolytics, epigenetic reprogramming, or AI-driven personalized medicine enable radical life extension by 2070s. A cohort receiving early interventions lives healthily past 130. One individual, benefiting from cumulative therapies and optimal genetics, reaches 145–150. Verification is maintained via global digital health records and blockchain-backed age validation.

Final Forecast:

Given the extreme uncertainty over 75 years, biological limits, and potential for black swan breakthroughs or catastrophes, I anchor on the base rate (122.5) and widen intervals significantly to account for unknown unknowns. I weight 60% on continuation of current trends (slow creep), 30% on moderate breakthroughs (130–140), and 10% on extreme scenarios (collapse or radical extension). I avoid overconfidence by ensuring 90% CI spans from plausible stagnation to highly optimistic biotech success.

Reasoning from forecaster5 for URL dummy://test.com: (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known: Approximately 75 years (from 2025-09-12 to 2100).  

(b) The outcome if nothing changed: 122 years. If there are no medical advancements, pandemics, or shifts in healthcare access, the oldest verified age is likely to remain at Jeanne Calment’s record of 122 years, as supercentenarian records have stagnated since 1997.  

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued: 123–124 years. The current trend shows slow, incremental increases in the number of supercentenarians but no breakthroughs in maximum lifespan. Over 75 years, minor improvements in elderly care or nutrition might push the record slightly higher, but not dramatically.  

(d) The expectations of experts and markets: Most gerontologists and demographers predict the maximum lifespan will stay below 125 years, with a median estimate around 122–124 years. No liquid markets exist, but expert surveys consistently cite 120–125 as the "biological ceiling" for humans without radical interventions.  

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome: A global health crisis (e.g., a more lethal pandemic than COVID-19, or a collapse in healthcare systems for the elderly) could decimate supercentenarian populations. For example, a widespread disease targeting older adults might reduce the maximum age to 115–120 years by 2100.  

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome: A breakthrough in anti-aging science—such as widespread access to regenerative medicine (e.g., stem cell therapy to repair aging organs) or gene editing to eliminate age-related diseases—could extend healthy lifespans drastically. If such technologies are developed by 2050, the oldest human might reach 140–150 years.

Reasoning from forecaster6 for URL dummy://test.com:  (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known:
As of September 12, 2025, there are 75 years remaining until the year 2100. This is the maximum time frame within which the age of the oldest human at that time will be determined.

(b) The outcome if nothing changed:
If we assume that no significant changes occur in medical technology, lifestyle, or environmental factors, the age of the oldest human in 2100 might not surpass the current record of 122 years and 164 days. This is based on the rarity of supercentenarians and the current biological limits of human lifespan.

(c) The outcome if the current trend continued:
If the current trend of slow but steady increases in life expectancy and improvements in healthcare continue, we might see a modest increase in the maximum age of humans. However, given the biological constraints and the slowing rate of increase in life expectancy, it's unlikely that we would see a dramatic shift from the current record by 2100.

(d) The expectations of experts and markets:
Experts in gerontology and demography generally agree that while life expectancy will likely continue to rise, the number of individuals reaching extreme old age (120+) will remain low. The consensus is that while some individuals may live beyond 120, exceeding the current record is uncertain, and significant breakthroughs in longevity would be needed to substantially extend the maximum human lifespan.

(e) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a low outcome:
An unexpected global health crisis, worse than the COVID-19 pandemic, could emerge, leading to widespread mortality and a significant setback in life expectancy gains. Additionally, if advancements in medical technology and healthcare systems stagnate or regress due to economic downturns, political instability, or resource scarcity, this could also result in a lower-than-expected maximum age.

(f) A brief description of an unexpected scenario that results in a high outcome:
A breakthrough in anti-aging medicine, such as effective regenerative therapies, gene editing techniques that address the root causes of aging, or the development of drugs that significantly slow down the aging process, could lead to a substantial increase in human lifespan. If such technologies are developed and become widely accessible, it could lead to a scenario where the maximum age exceeds current expectations by a large margin.

Given these considerations, my final answer, expressed in percentiles, accounts for a wide range of possible outcomes, reflecting the uncertainty inherent in such long-term predictions:

"
Percentile 10: 110
Percentile 20: 115
Percentile 40: 120
Percentile 60: 125
Percentile 80: 130
Percentile 90: 135
"

This distribution reflects the possibility of both unexpected negative impacts on longevity and potential breakthroughs in longevity science. The lower percentiles account for stagnation or regression in medical advancements and global health crises, while the higher percentiles reflect the potential for significant scientific breakthroughs that could extend the human lifespan beyond current records.

Synthesized reasoning (using openrouter/openai/gpt-4o) for URL dummy://test.com: To synthesize a final balanced distribution, we can analyze the agreements and disagreements among the forecasters and apply various heuristics to resolve them.

**Agreements:**
1. All forecasters agree that if nothing changes, the age of the oldest human by 2100 would likely remain around Jeanne Calment's record of 122 years.
2. Most forecasters predict a modest increase in the maximum age if current trends continue, generally placing it in the range of 123-130 years.
3. There is consensus that unexpected scenarios could lead to both lower and higher outcomes, with potential breakthroughs in anti-aging medicine being a key factor for higher outcomes.

**Disagreements:**
1. The forecasters differ on the extent of potential breakthroughs and their impact on maximum lifespan, with some predicting ages as high as 160 years.
2. There is variation in the lower percentiles, with some forecasters considering more pessimistic scenarios (e.g., 110 years).

**Heuristics Applied:**
- **Base Rates:** The historical record of 122 years is a strong anchor, suggesting a conservative approach to extreme predictions.
- **Bayesian Updates:** Consider the slow but steady increase in life expectancy and the potential for medical advancements, but also the uncertainty of breakthroughs.
- **Fermi Estimates:** Forecaster 1 provides a detailed breakdown, suggesting a ~10% chance of significant breakthroughs leading to ages of 137+ years.
- **Wide Intervals:** Given the uncertainty over 75 years, it's prudent to maintain wide intervals to account for unknown unknowns.
- **Bias Avoidance:** Avoid overconfidence in extreme scenarios, both high and low, by balancing optimism with historical data.

**Final Balanced Distribution:**
Percentile 10: 115  
Percentile 20: 120  
Percentile 40: 124  
Percentile 60: 128  
Percentile 80: 135
