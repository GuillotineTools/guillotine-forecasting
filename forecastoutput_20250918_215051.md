Found Research for URL dummy://test.com:
To assess the question of what the age of the oldest human will be as of 2100, we need to consider several factors, including current records, trends in longevity, and expert opinions.

### Current Record
As of October 2023, the oldest verified person is Mar√≠a Branyas Morera, born on March 4, 1907, making her 116 years old. The Guinness World Records recognizes her as the oldest living person. The record for the oldest verified age is held by Jeanne Calment, who lived to be 122 years and 164 days, passing away in 1997.

### Trends in Longevity
1. **Advancements in Healthcare**: There have been significant advancements in healthcare, nutrition, and lifestyle that contribute to increased life expectancy. However, the rate of increase in maximum lifespan has not kept pace with average life expectancy improvements.
   
2. **Biological Limits**: Experts suggest that there may be biological limits to human lifespan. While average life expectancy continues to rise, the maximum lifespan has remained relatively stable, with Jeanne Calment's record standing for over two decades.

3. **Demographic Changes**: The global population is aging, and the number of centenarians is increasing. However, the number of supercentenarians (people aged 110 and older) remains small.

### Expert Opinions
- **Gerontology Experts**: Some gerontologists argue that while average lifespans may continue to increase, the maximum lifespan is unlikely to exceed 125 years in the near future due to biological constraints.
- **Longevity Research**: Research into genetics, regenerative medicine, and anti-aging therapies is ongoing, but no consensus exists on whether these will significantly extend maximum lifespan.

### Base Rates and Historical Context
- Historically, the oldest verified age has not exceeded 122 years. The base rate for supercentenarians suggests that while more people are living longer, the likelihood of surpassing existing records remains low.

### Missing Factors
- **Future Medical Breakthroughs**: Potential breakthroughs in genetics, biotechnology, and personalized medicine could alter the landscape of human longevity.
- **Environmental Factors**: Changes in lifestyle, diet, and environmental conditions could also impact longevity in unforeseen ways.

### Conclusion
Based on current information, the oldest verified age as of 2100 is likely to remain below 125 years, given historical trends and biological limits. The resolution of the question will depend on whether a new record is established by that time. If no one surpasses Jeanne Calment's record, the answer will be "No." If someone does exceed that age, the answer will be "Yes." 

### Current Consensus
As of now, the consensus leans towards skepticism about significantly extending the maximum human lifespan beyond current records, suggesting that the age of the oldest human as of 2100 will likely not exceed 122 years.

Reasoning from forecaster1 for URL dummy://test.com: ### (a) Time Left Until the Outcome is Known
As of today, September 18, 2025, there are approximately 75 years until the year 2100.

### (b) Outcome if Nothing Changed
If current trends and records remain unchanged, the oldest verified age will likely remain at 122 years, as established by Jeanne Calment. Therefore, the outcome would be 122 years.

### (c) Outcome if the Current Trend Continued
If the current trend of increasing life expectancy continues but does not significantly alter the maximum lifespan, we might expect the oldest human to reach around 125 years by 2100. However, given the historical stability of maximum lifespan, I would estimate the outcome to be around 123 years.

### (d) Expectations of Experts and Markets
Experts generally express skepticism about significant increases in maximum human lifespan beyond 125 years due to biological constraints. The consensus suggests that while average life expectancy may continue to rise, the maximum age is likely to remain close to current records. Therefore, I would estimate the outcome to be around 122 to 125 years, with a strong likelihood of not exceeding 125 years.

### (e) Unexpected Scenario Resulting in a Low Outcome
An unexpected scenario that could lead to a low outcome would be a global health crisis, such as a pandemic or widespread environmental disaster, that significantly impacts health and longevity. This could result in a decrease in the number of supercentenarians and potentially lower the maximum age reached by any individual.

### (f) Unexpected Scenario Resulting in a High Outcome
Conversely, an unexpected scenario that could lead to a high outcome would be a breakthrough in anti-aging therapies or regenerative medicine that significantly extends human lifespan. If such advancements were to occur, it could lead to individuals living well beyond the current record, potentially reaching ages of 130 years or more.

### Final Answer
Given the current understanding of longevity, expert opinions, and potential scenarios, I will provide a wide range of estimates to account for uncertainty:

Percentile 10: 100
Percentile 20: 110
Percentile 40: 120
Percentile 60: 125
Percentile 80: 130
