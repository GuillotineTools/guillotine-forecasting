Certainly! Here's a condensed version of the articles, focusing on key details relevant to forecasting the age of the oldest human by 2100:

The current record for human longevity is 122 years, held by Jeanne Calment. Advances in medicine, genetics, and biotechnology are crucial factors that could push human lifespan beyond this record. Researchers are exploring various avenues, such as anti-aging drugs, gene therapies, and regenerative medicine, to slow down or reverse the aging process. Caloric restriction and lifestyle changes are also being studied for their potential to extend life. Some scientists are optimistic, suggesting that breakthroughs in these fields could significantly increase maximum lifespan within this century. However, others caution that biological limits may still cap human longevity despite technological advancements. Ethical considerations and accessibility of life-extending treatments are additional factors that could influence future records. The interplay between genetic predispositions and environmental factors will also play a role in determining the age of the oldest human by 2100. Overall, while extending human lifespan beyond 122 years is plausible, numerous scientific, ethical, and societal challenges must be addressed.

This summary captures the essential points related to potential lifespan extension and the factors influencing the age of the oldest human by 2100.
