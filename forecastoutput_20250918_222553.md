Found Research for URL dummy://test.com:
To analyze the question of what the age of the oldest human will be as of 2100, we need to consider several factors, including current records, trends in human longevity, and expert opinions.

### Current Context
1. **Current Record**: As of October 2023, the oldest verified person is Mar√≠a Branyas Morera, born on March 4, 1907, making her 116 years old. The Guinness World Records recognizes her as the oldest living person. Historically, the oldest verified age reached was 122 years, by Jeanne Calment in 1997.

2. **Trends in Longevity**: Advances in healthcare, nutrition, and overall living conditions have contributed to increasing life expectancy. However, there are biological limits to human lifespan. The consensus among gerontologists suggests that while more individuals may live longer, the record for the oldest age may not significantly increase beyond current limits.

3. **Expert Opinions**: Experts like Dr. David Sinclair and Dr. Nir Barzilai focus on the biological mechanisms of aging and suggest that while we may see more centenarians, surpassing the current record of 122 years is uncertain. Some studies indicate a potential plateau in maximum lifespan, while others discuss the possibility of breakthroughs in aging research that could extend life further.

4. **Base Rates**: Historically, the age of the oldest verified individuals has not significantly increased over the last few decades. The maximum lifespan appears to be around 120-125 years, as evidenced by the historical data of record-holders.

5. **Missing Factors**: Factors that could influence this forecast include potential medical breakthroughs in anti-aging therapies, societal changes that affect health (e.g., lifestyle diseases, environmental factors), and the demographic shifts in aging populations. Additionally, the impact of climate change and global health crises (like pandemics) on longevity could be significant.

### Conclusion
Based on current information, the consensus suggests that while more people are living longer, surpassing the age of 122 years by 2100 is uncertain. The official Guinness record for the oldest human as of 2100 will likely depend on whether any individual can surpass Jeanne Calment's record. Given historical trends and expert opinions, it seems plausible that the oldest verified age may remain close to the current maximum.

**Resolution**: The question will likely resolve as "No" if the oldest human does not exceed the age of 122 years by 2100, based on current evidence and expert consensus. However, there remains a level of uncertainty due to potential future advancements in longevity research.

Reasoning from forecaster1 for URL dummy://test.com: ### (a) Time Left Until Outcome is Known
As of today, September 18, 2025, there are approximately 75 years until the year 2100.

### (b) Outcome if Nothing Changed
If the current trends and records remain unchanged, the oldest verified human age would likely remain at 122 years, as set by Jeanne Calment in 1997. Therefore, the outcome would be 122 years.

### (c) Outcome if Current Trend Continued
If the trend of increasing life expectancy continues but does not significantly alter the biological limits of human lifespan, we may see more individuals reaching ages close to 120 years, but the record may remain around 122 years. Thus, the outcome could be around 123 years, allowing for slight increases due to better healthcare.

### (d) Expectations of Experts and Markets
Experts generally agree that while the number of centenarians will likely increase, the record for the oldest individual may not surpass 122 years by 2100. Many believe that biological limits exist, and while advancements in medicine could extend lifespan, the oldest age recorded may not significantly exceed current records. Therefore, a conservative estimate would be around 123 years, with some experts suggesting it could be slightly higher if breakthroughs occur.

### (e) Unexpected Scenario Resulting in a Low Outcome
An unexpected scenario that could lead to a lower outcome could involve a global health crisis, such as a pandemic that disproportionately affects the elderly. If such a crisis leads to increased mortality rates among older populations, the oldest verified age might remain stagnant or even decline, resulting in an outcome closer to 120 years.

### (f) Unexpected Scenario Resulting in a High Outcome
Conversely, an unexpected scenario that could result in a higher outcome could involve significant breakthroughs in anti-aging therapies, such as gene editing or advanced regenerative medicine, leading to a dramatic extension of human lifespan. If such advancements allow individuals to live well into their 130s or beyond, we could see the oldest human age reach 130 years or more.

### Final Answer
Taking into account the current trends, expert opinions, and potential scenarios, I will provide a range of estimates that reflect a wide confidence interval:

"
Percentile 10: 120
Percentile 20: 121
Percentile 40: 122
Percentile 60: 123
Percentile 80: 125
Percentile 90: 130
"
